51918182	four meetings  by henry james  1885   i saw her only four times but i remember them vividly she made an impression upon me i thought her very pretty and very interestinga charming specimen of a type i am very sorry to hear of her death and yet when i think of it why should i be sorry the last time i saw her she was certainly notbut i will describe all our meetings in order     i  the first one took place in the country at a little teaparty one snowy night it must have been some seventeen years ago my friend latouche going to spend christmas with his mother had persuaded me to go with him and the good lady had given in our honor the entertainment of which i speak to me it was really entertaining i had never been in the depths of new england at that season it had been snowing all day and the drifts were kneehigh i wondered how the ladies had made their way to the house but i perceived that at grimwinter a conversazione offering the attraction of two gentlemen from new york was felt to be worth an effort  mrs latouche in the course of the evening asked me if i did nt want to show the photographs to some of the young ladies the photographs were in a couple of great portfolios and had been brought home by her son who like myself was lately returned from europe i looked round and was struck with the fact that most of the young ladies were provided with an object of interest more absorbing than the most vivid sunpicture but there was a person standing alone near the mantelshelf and looking round the room with a small gentle smile which seemed at odds somehow with her isolation i looked at her a moment and then said i should like to show them to that young lady  oh yes said mrs latouche she is just the person she doesnt care for flirting i will speak to her  i rejoined that if she did not care for flirting she was perhaps not just the person but mrs latouche had already gone to propose the photographs to her  shes delighted she said coming back she is just the person so quiet and so bright and then she told me the young lady was by name miss caroline spencer and with this she introduced me  miss caroline spencer was not exactly a beauty but she was a charming little figure she must have been close upon thirty but she was made almost like a little girl and she had the complexion of a child she had a very pretty head and her hair was arranged as nearly as possible like the hair of a greek bust though indeed it was to be doubted if she had ever seen a greek bust she was artistic i suspected so far as grimwinter allowed such tendencies she had a soft surprised eye and thin lips with very pretty teeth round her neck she wore what ladies call i believe a ruche fastened with a very small pin in pink coral and in her hand she carried a fan made of plaited straw and adorned with pink ribbon she wore a scanty black silk dress she spoke with a kind of soft precision showing her white teeth between her narrow but tenderlooking lips and she seemed extremely pleased even a little fluttered at the prospect of my demonstrations these went forward very smoothly after i had moved the portfolios out of their corner and placed a couple of chairs near a lamp the photographs were usually things i knewlarge views of switzerland italy and spain landscapes copies of famous buildings pictures and statues i said what i could about them and my companion looking at them as i held them up sat perfectly still with her straw fan raised to her underlip occasionally as i laid one of the pictures down she said very softly have you seen that place i usually answered that i had seen it several times i had been a great traveller and then i felt that she looked at me askance for a moment with her pretty eyes i had asked her at the outset whether she had been to europe to this she answered no no no in a little quick confidential whisper but after that though she never took her eyes off the pictures she said so little that i was afraid she was bored accordingly after we had finished one portfolio i offered if she desired it to desist i felt that she was not bored but her reticence puzzled me and i wished to make her speak i turned round to look at her and saw that there was a faint flush in each of her cheeks she was waving her little fan to and fro instead of looking at me she fixed her eyes upon the other portfolio which was leaning against the table  wont you show me that she asked with a little tremor in her voice i could almost have believed she was agitated  with pleasure i answered if you are not tired  no i am not tired she affirmed i like iti love it  and as i took up the other portfolio she laid her hand upon it rubbing it softly  and have you been here too she asked  on my opening the portfolio it appeared that i had been there one of the first photographs was a large view of the castle of chillon on the lake of geneva  here i said i have been many a time is it not beautiful and i pointed to the perfect reflection of the rugged rocks and pointed towers in the clear still water she did not say oh enchanting and push it away to see the next picture she looked awhile and then she asked if it was not where bonnivard about whom byron wrote was confined i assented and tried to quote some of byrons verses but in this attempt i succeeded imperfectly  she fanned herself a moment and then repeated the lines correctly in a soft flat and yet agreeable voice by the time she had finished she was blushing i complimented her and told her she was perfectly equipped for visiting switzerland and italy she looked at me askance again to see whether i was serious and i added that if she wished to recognize byrons descriptions she must go abroad speedily europe was getting sadly disbyronized  how soon must i go she asked  oh i will give you ten years  i think i can go within ten years she answered very soberly  well i said you will enjoy it immensely you will find it very charming and just then i came upon a photograph of some nook in a foreign city which i had been very fond of and which recalled tender memories i discoursed as i suppose with a certain eloquence my companion sat listening breathless  have you been very long in foreign lands she asked some time after i had ceased  many years i said  and have you travelled everywhere  i have travelled a great deal i am very fond of it and happily i have been able  again she gave me her sidelong gaze and do you know the foreign languages  after a fashion  is it hard to speak them  i dont believe you would find it hard i gallantly responded  oh i shouldnt want to speak i should only want to listen she said then after a pause she added they say the french theatre is so beautiful  it is the best in the world  did you go there very often  when i was first in paris i went every night  every night and she opened her clear eyes very wide that to me is and she hesitated a momentis very wonderful a few minutes later she asked which country do you prefer  there is one country i prefer to all others i think you would do the same  she looked at me a moment and then she said softly italy  italy i answered softly too and for a moment we looked at each other she looked as pretty as if instead of showing her photographs i had been making love to her to increase the analogy she glanced away blushing there was a silence which she broke at last by saying  that is the place which in particular i thought of going to  oh thats the place thats the place i said  she looked at two or three photographs in silence they say it is not so dear  as some other countries yes that is not the least of its charms  but it is all very dear is it not  europe you mean  going there and travelling that has been the trouble i have very little money i give lessons said miss spencer  of course one must have money i said but one can manage with a moderate amount  i think i should manage i have laid something by and i am always adding a little to it its all for that she paused a moment and then went on with a kind of suppressed eagerness as if telling me the story were a rare but a possibly impure satisfaction but it has not been only the money it has been everything everything has been against it i have waited and waited it has been a mere castle in the air i am almost afraid to talk about it two or three times it has been a little nearer and then i have talked about it and it has melted away i have talked about it too much she said hypocritically for i saw that such talking was now a small tremulous ecstasy there is a lady who is a great friend of mine she does nt want to go i always talk to her about it i tire her dreadfully she told me once she did nt know what would become of me i should go crazy if i did not go to europe and i should certainly go crazy if i did  well i said you have not gone yet and nevertheless you are not crazy  she looked at me a moment and said i am not so sure i dont think of anything else i am always thinking of it it prevents me from thinking of things that are nearer home things that i ought to attend to that is a kind of craziness  the cure for it is to go i said  i have a faith that i shall go i have a cousin in europe she announced  we turned over some more photographs and i asked her if she had always lived at grimwinter  oh no sir said miss spencer i have spent twentythree months in boston  i answered jocosely that in that case foreign lands would probably prove a disappointment to her but i quite failed to alarm her  i know more about them than you might think she said with her shy neat little smile i mean by reading i have read a great deal i have not only read byron i have read histories and guidebooks i know i shall like it  i understand your case i rejoined you have the native american passionthe passion for the picturesque with us i think it is primordialantecedent to experience experience comes and only shows us something we have dreamt of  i think that is very true said caroline spencer i have dreamt of everything i shall know it all  i am afraid you have wasted a great deal of time  oh yes that has been my great wickedness  the people about us had begun to scatter they were taking their leave she got up and put out her hand to me timidly but with a peculiar brightness in her eyes  i am going back there i said as i shook hands with her i shall look out for you  i will tell you she answered if i am disappointed  and she went away looking delicately agitated and moving her little straw fan     ii  a few months after this i returned to europe and some three years elapsed i had been living in paris and toward the end of october i went from that city to havre to meet my sister and her husband who had written me that they were about to arrive there on reaching havre i found that the steamer was already in i was nearly two hours late i repaired directly to the hotel where my relatives were already established my sister had gone to bed exhausted and disabled by her voyage she was a sadly incompetent sailor and her sufferings on this occasion had been extreme she wished for the moment for undisturbed rest and was unable to see me more than five minutes so it was agreed that we should remain at havre until the next day my brotherinlaw who was anxious about his wife was unwilling to leave her room but she insisted upon his going out with me to take a walk and recover his landlegs the early autumn day was warm and charming and our stroll through the brightcolored busy streets of the old french seaport was sufficiently entertaining we walked along the sunny noisy quays and then turned into a wide pleasant street which lay half in sun and half in shadea french provincial street that looked like an old watercolor drawing tall gray steeproofed redgabled manystoried houses green shutters on windows and old scrollwork above them flowerpots in balconies and whitecapped women in doorways we walked in the shade all this stretched away on the sunny side of the street and made a picture we looked at it as we passed along then suddenly my brotherinlaw stopped pressing my arm and staring i followed his gaze and saw that we had paused just before coming to a café where under an awning several tables and chairs were disposed upon the pavement the windows were open behind half a dozen plants in tubs were ranged beside the door the pavement was besprinkled with clean bran it was a nice little quiet oldfashioned café inside in the comparative dusk i saw a stout handsome woman with pink ribbons in her cap perched up with a mirror behind her back smiling at some one who was out of sight all this however i perceived afterwards what i first observed was a lady sitting alone outside at one of the little marbletopped tables my brotherinlaw had stopped to look at her there was something on the little table but she was leaning back quietly with her hands folded looking down the street away from us i saw her only in something less than profile nevertheless i instantly felt that i had seen her before  the little lady of the steamer exclaimed my brotherinlaw  was she on your steamer i asked  from morning till night she was never sick she used to sit perpetually at the side of the vessel with her hands crossed that way looking at the eastward horizon  are you going to speak to her  i dont know her i never made acquaintance with her i was too seedy but i used to watch her andi dont know whyto be interested in her shes a dear little yankee woman i have an idea she is a schoolmistress taking a holiday for which her scholars have made up a purse  she turned her face a little more into profile looking at the steep gray housefronts opposite to her then i said i shall speak to her myself  i would nt she is very shy said my brotherinlaw  my dear fellow i know her i once showed her photographs at a teaparty  and i went up to her she turned and looked at me and i saw she was in fact miss caroline spencer but she was not so quick to recognize me she looked startled i pushed a chair to the table and sat down  well i said i hope you are not disappointed  she stared blushing a little then she gave a small jump which betrayed recognition  it was you who showed me the photographs at grimwinter  yes it was i this happens very charmingly for i feel as if it were for me to give you a formal reception here an official welcome i talked to you so much about europe  you did nt say too much i am so happy she softly exclaimed  very happy she looked there was no sign of her being older she was as gravely decently demurely pretty as before if she had seemed before a thinstemmed mildhued flower of puritanism it may be imagined whether in her present situation this delicate bloom was less apparent beside her an old gentleman was drinking absinthe behind her the dame de comptoir in the pink ribbons was calling alcibiade alcibiade to the longaproned waiter i explained to miss spencer that my companion had lately been her shipmate and my brotherinlaw came up and was introduced to her but she looked at him as if she had never seen him before and i remembered that he had told me that her eyes were always fixed upon the eastward horizon she had evidently not noticed him and still timidly smiling she made no attempt whatever to pretend that she had i stayed with her at the café door and he went back to the hotel and to his wife i said to miss spencer that this meeting of ours in the first hour of her landing was really very strange but that i was delighted to be there and receive her first impressions  oh i cant tell you she said i feel as if i were in a dream i have been sitting here for an hour and i dont want to move everything is so picturesque i dont know whether the coffee has intoxicated me it s so delicious  really said i if you are so pleased with this poor prosaic havre you will have no admiration left for better things dont spend your admiration all the first day remember its your intellectual letter of credit remember all the beautiful places and things that are waiting for you remember that lovely italy  i m not afraid of running short she said gayly still looking at the opposite houses i could sit here all day saying to myself that here i am at last its so dark and old and different  by the way i inquired how come you to be sitting here have you not gone to one of the inns for i was half amused half alarmed at the good conscience with which this delicately pretty woman had stationed herself in conspicuous isolation on the edge of the trottoir  my cousin brought me here she answered you know i told you i had a cousin in europe he met me at the steamer this morning  it was hardly worth his while to meet you if he was to desert you so soon  oh he has only left me for half an hour said miss spencer he has gone to get my money  where is your money  she gave a little laugh it makes me feel very fine to tell you it is in some circular notes  and where are your circular notes  in my cousins pocket  this statement was very serenely uttered buti can hardly say whyit gave me a sensible chill at the moment i should have been utterly unable to give the reason of this sensation for i knew nothing of miss spencers cousin since he was her cousin the presumption was in his favor but i felt suddenly uncomfortable at the thought that half an hour after her landing her scanty funds should have passed into his hands  is he to travel with you i asked  only as far as paris he is an artstudent in paris i wrote to him that i was coming but i never expected him to come off to the ship i supposed he would only just meet me at the train in paris it is very kind of him but he is very kind and very bright  i instantly became conscious of an extreme curiosity to see this bright cousin who was an artstudent  he is gone to the bankers i asked  yes to the bankers he took me to a hotel such a queer quaint delicious little place with a court in the middle and a gallery all round and a lovely landlady in such a beautifully fluted cap and such a perfectly fitting dress after a while we came out to walk to the bankers for i havent got any french money but i was very dizzy from the motion of the vessel and i thought i had better sit down he found this place for me here and he went off to the bankers himself i am to wait here till he comes back  it may seem very fantastic but it passed through my mind that he would never come back i settled myself in my chair beside miss spencer and determined to await the event she was extremely observant there was something touching in it she noticed everything that the movement of the street brought before uspeculiarities of costume the shapes of vehicles the big norman horses the fat priests the shaven poodles we talked of these things and there was something charming in her freshness of perception and the way her booknourished fancy recognized and welcomed everything  and when your cousin comes back what are you going to do i asked  she hesitated a moment we dont quite know  when do you go to paris if you go by the four oclock train i may have the pleasure of making the journey with you  i dont think we shall do that my cousin thinks i had better stay here a few days  oh said i and for five minutes said nothing more i was wondering what her cousin was in vulgar parlance up to i looked up and down the street but saw nothing that looked like a bright american artstudent at last i took the liberty of observing that havre was hardly a place to choose as one of the æsthetic stations of a european tour it was a place of convenience nothing more a place of transit through which transit should be rapid i recommended her to go to paris by the afternoon train and meanwhile to amuse herself by driving to the ancient fortress at the mouth of the harborthat picturesque circular structure which bore the name of francis the first and looked like a small castle of st angelo it has lately been demolished  she listened with much interest then for a moment she looked grave  my cousin told me that when he returned he should have something particular to say to me and that we could do nothing or decide nothing until i should have heard it but i will make him tell me quickly and then we will go to the ancient fortress there is no hurry to get to paris there is plenty of time  she smiled with her softly severe little lips as she spoke those last words but i looking at her with a purpose saw just a tiny gleam of apprehension in her eye  dont tell me i said that this wretched man is going to give you bad news  i suspect it is a little bad but i dont believe it is very bad at any rate i must listen to it  i looked at her again an instant you did nt come to europe to listen i said you came to see but now i was sure her cousin would come back since he had something disagreeable to say to her he certainly would turn up we sat a while longer and i asked her about her plans of travel she had them on her fingers ends and she told over the names with a kind of solemn distinctness from paris to dijon and to avignon from avignon to marseilles and the cornice road thence to genoa to spezia to pisa to florence to home it apparently had never occurred to her that there could be the least incommodity in her travelling alone and since she was unprovided with a companion i of course scrupulously abstained from disturbing her sense of security at last her cousin came back i saw him turn towards us out of a side street and from the moment my eyes rested upon him i felt that this was the bright american artstudent he wore a slouch hat and a rusty black velvet jacket such as i had often encountered in the rue bonaparte his shirtcollar revealed the elongation of a throat which at a distance was not strikingly statuesque he was tall and lean he had red hair and freckles so much i had time to observe while he approached the café staring at me with natural surprise from under his umbrageous coiffure when he came up to us i immediately introduced myself to him as an old acquaintance of miss spencer he looked at me hard with a pair of little red eyes then he made me a solemn bow in the french fashion with his sombrero  you were not on the ship he said  no i was not on the ship i have been in europe these three years  he bowed once more solemnly and motioned me to be seated again i sat down but it was only for the purpose of observing him an instant i saw it was time i should return to my sister miss spencers cousin was a queer fellow nature had not shaped him for a raphaelesque or byronic attire and his velvet doublet and naked neck were not in harmony with his facial attributes his hair was cropped close to his head his ears were large and illadjusted to the same he had a lackadaisical carriage and a sentimental droop which were peculiarly at variance with his keen strangecolored eyes perhaps i was prejudiced but i thought his eyes treacherous he said nothing for some time he leaned his hands on his cane and looked up and down the street then at last slowly lifting his cane and pointing with it thats a very nice bit he remarked softly he had his head on one side and his little eyes were half closed i followed the direction of his stick the object it indicated was a red cloth hung out of an old window nice bit of color he continued and without moving his head he transferred his halfclosed gaze to me composes well he pursued make a nice thing he spoke in a hard vulgar voice  i see you have a great deal of eye i replied your cousin tells me you are studying art he looked at me in the same way without answering and i went on with deliberate urbanity i suppose you are at the studio of one of those great men  still he looked at me and then he said softly gérôme  do you like it i asked  do you understand french he said  some kinds i answered  he kept his little eyes on me then he said jadore la peinture  oh i understand that kind i rejoined miss spencer laid her hand upon her cousins arm with a little pleased and fluttered movement it was delightful to be among people who were on such easy terms with foreign tongues i got up to take leave and asked miss spencer where in paris i might have the honor of waiting upon her to what hotel would she go  she turned to her cousin inquiringly and he honored me again with his little languid leer do you know the hôtel des princes  i know where it is  i shall take her there  i congratulate you i said to caroline spencer i believe it is the best inn in the world and in case i should still have a moment to call upon you here where are you lodged  oh its such a pretty name said miss spencer gleefully À la belle normande  as i left them her cousin gave me a great flourish with his picturesque hat     iii  my sister as it proved was not sufficiently restored to leave havre by the afternoon train so that as the autumn dusk began to fall i found myself at liberty to call at the sign of the fair norman i must confess that i had spent much of the interval in wondering what the disagreeable thing was that my charming friends disagreeable cousin had been telling her the belle normande was a modest inn in a shady bystreet where it gave me satisfaction to think miss spencer must have encountered local color in abundance there was a crooked little court where much of the hospitality of the house was carried on there was a staircase climbing to bedrooms on the outer side of the wall there was a small trickling fountain with a stucco statuette in the midst of it there was a little boy in a white cap and apron cleaning copper vessels at a conspicuous kitchen door there was a chattering landlady neatly laced arranging apricots and grapes into an artistic pyramid upon a pink plate i looked about and on a green bench outside of an open door labelled salle à manger i perceived caroline spencer no sooner had i looked at her than i saw that something had happened since the morning she was leaning back on her bench her hands were clasped in her lap and her eyes were fixed upon the landlady at the other side of the court manipulating her apricots  but i saw she was not thinking of apricots she was staring absently thoughtfully as i came near her i perceived that she had been crying i sat down on the bench beside her before she saw me then when she had done so she simply turned round without surprise and rested her sad eyes upon me something very bad indeed had happened she was completely changed  i immediately charged her with it your cousin has been giving you bad news you are in great distress  for a moment she said nothing and i supposed that she was afraid to speak lest her tears should come back but presently i perceived that in the short time that had elapsed since my leaving her in the morning she had shed them all and that she was now softly stoical intensely composed  my poor cousin is in distress she said at last his news was bad then after a brief hesitation he was in terrible want of money  in want of yours you mean  of any that he could gethonestly mine was the only money  and he has taken yours  she hesitated again a moment but her glance meanwhile was pleading i gave him what i had  i have always remembered the accent of those words as the most angelic bit of human utterance i had ever listened to but then almost with a sense of personal outrage i jumped up good heavens i said do you call that getting it honestly  i had gone too far she blushed deeply we will not speak of it she said  we must speak of it i answered sitting down again i am your friend it seems to me you need one what is the matter with your cousin  he is in debt  no doubt but what is the special fitness of your paying his debts  he has told me all his story i am very sorry for him  so am i but i hope he will give you back your money  certainly he will as soon as he can  when will that be  when he has finished his great picture  my dear young lady confound his great picture where is this desperate cousin  she certainly hesitated now thenat his dinner she answered  i turned about and looked through the open door into the salle à manger there alone at the end of a long table i perceived the object of miss spencers compassion the bright young artstudent he was dining too attentively to notice me at first but in the act of setting down a wellemptied wineglass he caught sight of my observant attitude he paused in his repast and with his head on one side and his meagre jaws slowly moving fixedly returned my gaze then the landlady came lightly brushing by with her pyramid of apricots  and that nice little plate of fruit is for him i exclaimed  miss spencer glanced at it tenderly they do that so prettily she murmured  i felt helpless and irritated come now really i said do you approve of that long strong fellow accepting your funds she looked away from me i was evidently giving her pain the case was hopeless the long strong fellow had interested her  excuse me if i speak of him so unceremoniously i said but you are really too generous and he is not quite delicate enough he made his debts himself he ought to pay them himself  he has been foolish she answered i know that he has told me everything we had a long talk this morning the poor fellow threw himself upon my charity he has signed notes to a large amount  the more fool he  he is in extreme distress and it is not only himself it is his poor wife  ah he has a poor wife  i didnt know it but he confessed everything he married two years since secretly  why secretly  caroline spencer glanced about her as if she feared listeners then softly in a little impressive toneshe was a countess  are you very sure of that  she has written me a most beautiful letter  asking you for money eh  asking me for confidence and sympathy said miss spencer she has been disinherited by her father my cousin told me the story and she tells it in her own way in the letter it is like an old romance her father opposed the marriage and when he discovered that she had secretly disobeyed him he cruelly cast her off it is really most romantic they are the oldest family in provence  i looked and listened in wonder it really seemed that the poor woman was enjoying the romance of having a discarded countesscousin out of provence so deeply as almost to lose the sense of what the forfeiture of her money meant for her  my dear young lady i said you dont want to be ruined for picturesqueness sake  i shall not be ruined i shall come back before long to stay with them the countess insists upon that  come back you are going home then  she sat for a moment with her eyes lowered then with an heroic suppression of a faint tremor of the voicei have no money for travelling she answered  you gave it all up  i have kept enough to take me home  i gave an angry groan and at this juncture miss spencers cousin the fortunate possessor of her sacred savings and of the hand of the provençal countess emerged from the little diningroom he stood on the threshold for an instant removing the stone from a plump apricot which he had brought away from the table then he put the apricot into his mouth and while he let it sojourn there gratefully stood looking at us with his long legs apart and his hands dropped into the pockets of his velvet jacket my companion got up giving him a thin glance which i caught in its passage and which expressed a strange commixture of resignation and fascinationa sort of perverted exaltation ugly vulgar pretentious dishonest as i thought the creature he had appealed successfully to her eager and tender imagination i was deeply disgusted but i had no warrant to interfere and at any rate i felt that it would be vain  the young man waved his hand with a pictorial gesture nice old court he observed nice mellow old place good tone in that brick nice crooked old staircase  decidedly i could nt stand it without responding i gave my hand to caroline spencer she looked at me an instant with her little white face and expanded eyes and as she showed her pretty teeth i suppose she meant to smile  dont be sorry for me she said i am very sure i shall see something of this dear old europe yet  i told her that i would not bid her goodby i should find a moment to come back the next morning her cousin who had put on his sombrero again flourished it off at me by way of a bow upon which i took my departure  the next morning i came back to the inn where i met in the court the landlady more loosely laced than in the evening on my asking for miss spencerpartie monsieu said the hostess she went away last night at ten o clock with herhernot her husband ehin fine her monsieur they went down to the american ship i turned away the poor girl had been about thirteen hours in europe     iv  i myself more fortunate was there some five years longer during this period i lost my friend latouche who died of a malarious fever during a tour in the levant one of the first things i did on my return was to go up to grimwinter to pay a consolatory visit to his poor mother i found her in deep affliction and i sat with her the whole of the morning that followed my arrival i had come in late at night listening to her tearful descant and singing the praises of my friend we talked of nothing else and our conversation terminated only with the arrival of a quick little woman who drove herself up to the door in a carryall and whom i saw toss the reins upon the horses back with the briskness of a startled sleeper throwing back the bedclothes she jumped out of the carryall and she jumped into the room she proved to be the ministers wife and the great towngossip and she had evidently in the latter capacity a choice morsel to communicate i was as sure of this as i was that poor mrs latouche was not absolutely too bereaved to listen to her it seemed to me discreet to retire i said i believed i would go and take a walk before dinner  and by the way i added if you will tell me where my old friend miss spencer lives i will walk to her house  the ministers wife immediately responded miss spencer lived in the fourth house beyond the baptist church the baptist church was the one on the right with that queer green thing over the door they called it a portico but it looked more like an oldfashioned bedstead  yes do go and see poor caroline said mrs latouche it will refresh her to see a strange face  i should think she had had enough of strange faces cried the ministers wife  i mean to see a visitor said mrs latouche amending her phrase  i should think she had had enough of visitors her companion rejoined but you dont mean to stay ten years she added glancing at me  has she a visitor of that sort i inquired perplexed  you will see the sort said the ministers wife shes easily seen she generally sits in the front yard only take care what you say to her and be very sure you are polite  ah she is so sensitive  the ministers wife jumped up and dropped me a curtsey a most ironical curtsey  thats what she is if you please shes a countess  and pronouncing this word with the most scathing accent the little woman seemed fairly to laugh in the countesss face i stood a moment staring wondering remembering  oh i shall be very polite i cried and grasping my hat and stick i went on my way  i found miss spencers residence without difficulty the baptist church was easily identified and the small dwelling near it of a rusty white with a large central chimneystack and a virginia creeper seemed naturally and properly the abode of a frugal old maid with a taste for the picturesque as i approached i slackened my pace for i had heard that some one was always sitting in the front yard and i wished to reconnoitre i looked cautiously over the low white fence which separated the small gardenspace from the unpaved street but i descried nothing in the shape of a countess a small straight path led up to the crooked doorstep and on either side of it was a little grassplot fringed with currantbushes in the middle of the grass on either side was a large quincetree full of antiquity and contortions and beneath one of the quincetrees were placed a small table and a couple of chairs on the table lay a piece of unfinished embroidery and two or three books in brightcolored paper covers i went in at the gate and paused halfway along the path scanning the place for some farther token of its occupant before whomi could hardly have said whyi hesitated abruptly to present myself then i saw that the poor little house was very shabby i felt a sudden doubt of my right to intrude for curiosity had been my motive and curiosity here seemed singularly indelicate while i hesitated a figure appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking at me i immediately recognized caroline spencer but she looked at me as if she had never seen me before gently but gravely and timidly i advanced to the doorstep and then i said with an attempt at friendly badinage  i waited for you over there to come back but you never came  waited where sir she asked softly and her lightcolored eyes expanded more than before  she was much older she looked tired and wasted  well i said i waited at havre  she stared then she recognized me she smiled and blushed and clasped her two hands together i remember you now she said i remember that day but she stood there neither coming out nor asking me to come in she was embarrassed  i too felt a little awkward i poked my stick into the path i kept looking out for you year after year i said  you mean in europe murmured miss spencer  in europe of course here apparently you are easy enough to find  she leaned her hand against the unpainted doorpost and her head fell a little to one side she looked at me for a moment without speaking and i thought i recognized the expression that one sees in womens eyes when tears are rising suddenly she stepped out upon the cracked slab of stone before the threshold and closed the door behind her then she began to smile intently and i saw that her teeth were as pretty as ever but there had been tears too  have you been there ever since she asked almost in a whisper  until three weeks ago and youyou never came back  still looking at me with her fixed smile she put her hand behind her and opened the door again i am not very polite she said wont you come in  i am afraid i incommode you  oh no she answered smiling more than ever and she pushed back the door with a sign that i should enter  i went in following her she led the way to a small room on the left of the narrow hall which i supposed to be her parlor though it was at the back of the house and we passed the closed door of another apartment which apparently enjoyed a view of the quincetrees this one looked out upon a small woodshed and two clucking hens but i thought it very pretty until i saw that its elegance was of the most frugal kind after which presently i thought it prettier still for i had never seen faded chintz and old mezzotint engravings framed in varnished autumn leaves disposed in so graceful a fashion miss spencer sat down on a very small portion of the sofa with her hands tightly clasped in her lap she looked ten years older and it would have souuded very perverse now to speak of her as pretty but i thought her so or at least i thought her touching she was peculiarly agitated i tried to appear not to notice it but suddenly in the most inconsequent fashionit was an irresistible memory of our little friendship at havrei said to her i do incommode you you are distressed  she raised her two hands to her face and for a moment kept it buried in them then taking them awayits because you remind me she said  i remind you you mean of that miserable day at havre  she shook her head it was not miserable it was delightful  i never was so shocked as when on going back to your inn the next morning i found you had set sail again  she was silent a moment and then she said please let us not speak of that  did you come straight back here i asked  i was back here just thirty days after i had gone away  and here you have remained ever since  oh yes she said gently  when are you going to europe again  this question seemed brutal but there was something that irritated me in the softness of her resignation and i wished to extort from her some expression of impatience  she fixed her eyes for a moment upon a small sunspot on the carpet then she got up and lowered the windowblind a little to obliterate it presently in the same mild voice answering my question she said never  i hope your cousin repaid you your money  i dont care for it now she said looking away from me  you dont care for your money  for going to europe  do you mean that you would not go if you could  i canti cant said caroline spencer it is all over i never think of it  he never repaid you then i exclaimed  pleaseplease she began  but she stopped she was looking toward the door there had been a rustling aud a sound of steps in the hall  i also looked toward the door which was open and now admitted another person a lady who paused just within the threshold behind her came a young man the lady looked at me with a good deal of fixedness long enough for my glance to receive a vivid impression of herself then she turned to caroline spencer and with a smile and a strong foreign accent  excuse my interruption she said i knew not you had company the gentleman came in so quietly  with this she directed her eyes toward me again  she was very strange yet my first feeling was that i had seen her before then i perceived that i had only seen ladies who were very much like her but i had seen them very far away from grimwinter and it was an odd sensation to be seeing her here whither was it the sight of her seemed to transport me to some dusky landing before a shabby parisian quatrièmeto an open door revealing a greasy antechamber and to madame leaning over the banisters while she holds a faded dressinggown together and bawls down to the portress to bring up her coffee miss spencers visitor was a very large woman of middle age with a plump deadwhite face and hair drawn back a la chinoise she had a small penetrating eye and what is called in french an agreeable smile she wore an old pink cashmere dressinggown covered with white embroideries and like the figure in my momentary vision she was holding it together in front with a bare and rounded arm and a plump and deeply dimpled hand  it is only to spick about my café she said to miss spencer with her agreeable smile i should like it served in the garden under the leetle tree  the young man behind her had now stepped into the room and he also stood looking at me he was a prettyfaced little fellow with an air of provincial foppishnessa tiny adonis of grimwinter he had a small pointed nose a small pointed chin and as i observed the most diminutive feet he looked at me foolishly with his mouth open  you shall have your coffee said miss spencer who had a faint red spot in each of her cheeks  it is well said the lady in the dressinggown find your bouk she added turning to the young man  he gazed vaguely round the room my grammar d ye mean he asked with a helpless intonation  but the large lady was inspecting me curiously and gathering in her dressinggown with her white arm  find your bouk my friend she repeated  my poetry d ye mean said the young man also staring at me again  never mind your bouk said his companion today we will talk we will make some conversation but we must not interrupt come and she turned away under the leetle tree she added for the benefit of miss spencer  then she gave me a sort of salutation and a monsieur with which she swept away again followed by the young man  caroline spencer stood there with her eyes fixed upon the ground  who is that i asked  the countess my cousin  and who is the young man  her pupil mr mixter  this description of the relation between the two persons who had just left the room made me break into a little laugh miss spencer looked at me gravely  she gives french lessons she has lost her fortune  i see i said she is determined to be a burden to no one that is very proper  miss spencer looked down on the ground again i must go and get the coffee she said  has the lady many pupils i asked  she has only mr mixter she gives all her time to him  at this i could not laugh though i smelt provocation miss spencer was too grave he pays very well she presently added with simplicity he is very rich he is very kind he takes the countess to drive and she was turning away  you are going for the countesss coffee i said  if you will excuse me a few moments  is there no one else to do it  she looked at me with the softest serenity i keep no servants  can she not wait upon herself  she is not used to that  i see said i as gently as possible but before you go tell me this who is this lady  i told you about her beforethat day she is the wife of my cousin whom you saw  the lady who was disowned by her family in consequence of her marriage  yes they have never seen her again they have cast her off  and where is her husband  he is dead  and where is your money  the poor girl flinched there was something too consistent in my questions i dont know she said wearily  but i continued a moment on her husbands death this lady came over here  yes she arrived one day  how long ago  two years  she has been here ever since  every moment  how does she like it  not at all  and how do you like it  miss spencer laid her face in her two hands an instant as she had done ten minutes before  then quickly she went to get the countesss coffee  i remained alone in the little parlor i wanted to see more to learn more at the end of five minutes the young man whom miss spencer had described as the countesss pupil came in he stood looking at me for a moment with parted lips i saw he was a very rudimentary young man  she wants to know if you wont come out there he observed at last  who wants to know  the countess that french lady  she has asked you to bring me  yes sir said the young man feebly looking at my six feet of stature  i went out with him and we found the countess sitting under one of the little quincetrees in front of the house she was drawing a needle through the piece of embroidery which she had taken from the small table she pointed graciously to the chair beside her and i seated myself mr mixter glanced about him and then sat down in the grass at her feet he gazed upward looking with parted lips from the countess to me i am sure you speak french said the countess fixing her brilliant little eyes upon me  i do madam after a fashion i answered in the ladys own tongue  voilà she cried most expressively i knew it so soon as i looked at you you have been in my poor dear country  a long time  you know paris  thoroughly madam and with a certain conscious purpose i let my eyes meet her own  she presently hereupon moved her own and glanced down at mr mixter what are we talking about she demanded of her attentive pupil  he pulled his knees up plucked at the grass with his hand stared blushed a little you are talking french said mr mixter  la belle découverte said the countess here are ten months she explained to me that i am giving him lessons dont put yourself out not to say hes an idiot he wont understand you  i hope your other pupils are more gratifying i remarked  i have no others they dont know what french is in this place they dont want to know you may therefore imagine the pleasure it is to me to meet a person who speaks it like yourself i replied that my own pleasure was not less and she went on drawing her stitches through her embroidery with her little finger curled out every few moments she put her eyes close to her work nearsightedly i thought her a very disagreeable person she was coarse affected dishonest and no more a countess than i was a caliph talk to me of paris she went on the very name of it gives me an emotion how long since you were there  two months ago  happy man tell me something about it what were they doing oh for an hour of the boulevard  they were doing about what they are always doingamusing themselves a good deal  at the theatres eh sighed the countess at the cafésconcerts at the little tables in front of the doors quelle existence you know i am a parisienne monsieur she added to my fingertips  miss spencer was mistaken then i ventured to rejoin in telling me that you are a provençale  she stared a moment then she put her nose to her embroidery which had a dingy desultory aspect ah i am a provençale by birth but i am a parisienne byinclination  and by experience i suppose i said  she questioned me a moment with her hard little eyes oh experience i could talk of experience if i wished i never expected for example that experience had this in store for me and she pointed with her bare elbow and with a jerk of her head at everything that surrounded herat the little white house the quincetree the rickety paling even at mr mixter  you are in exile i said smiling  you may imagine what it is these two years that i have been here i have passed hourshours one gets used to things and sometimes i think i have got used to this but there are some things that are always beginning over again for example my coffee  do you always have coffee at this hour i inquired  she tossed back her head and measured me  at what hour would you prefer me to have it i must have my little cup after breakfast  ah you breakfast at this hour  at middaycomme cela se fait here they breakfast at a quarter past seven that quarter past is charming  but you were telling me about your coffee i observed sympathetically  my cousine cant believe in it she cant understand it shes an excellent girl but that little cup of black coffee with a drop of cognac served at this hourthey exceed her comprehension so i have to break the ice every day and it takes the coffee the time you see to arrive and when it arrives monsieur if i dont offer you any of it you must not take it ill it will be because i know you have drunk it on the boulevard  i resented extremely this scornful treatment of poor caroline spencers humble hospitality but i said nothing in order to say nothing uncivil i only looked on mr mixter who had clasped his arms round his knees and was watching my companions demonstrative graces in solemn fascination she presently saw that i was observing him she glanced at me with a little bold explanatory smile you know he adores me she murmured putting her nose into her tapestry again i expressed the promptest credence and she went on he dreams of becoming my lover yes its his dream he has read a french novel it took him six months but ever since that he has thought himself the hero and me the heroine  mr mixter had evidently not an idea that he was being talked about he was too preoccupied with the ecstasy of contemplation at this moment caroline spencer came out of the house bearing a coffeepot on a little tray i noticed that on her way from the door to the table she gave me a single quick vaguely appealing glance i wondered what it signified i felt that it signified a sort of halffrightened longing to know what as a man of the world who had been in france i thought of the countess it made me extremely uncomfortable i could not tell her that the countess was very possibly the runaway wife of a little hairdresser i tried suddenly on the contrary to show a high consideration for her but i got up i could nt stay longer it vexed me to see caroline spencer standing there like a waitingmaid  you expect to remain some time at grimwinter i said to the countess  she gave a terrible shrug  who knows perhaps for years when one is in miserychere belle she added turning to miss spencer you have forgotten the cognac  i detained caroline spencer as after looking a moment in silence at the little table she was turning away to procure this missing delicacy i silently gave her my hand in farewell she looked very tired but there was a strange hint of prospective patience in her severely mild little face i thought she was rather glad i was going mr mixter had risen to his feet and was pouring out the countesss coffee as i went back past the baptist church i reflected that poor miss spencer had been right in her presentiment that she should still see something of that dear old europe
