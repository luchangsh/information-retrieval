73237430	greville fane  by henry james     coming in to dress for dinner i found a telegram  mrs stormer dying can you give us half a column for tomorrow evening  let her off easy but not too easy  i was late i was in a hurry i had very little time to think but at a venture i dispatched a reply will do what i can  it was not till i had dressed and was rolling away to dinner that in the hansom i bethought myself of the difficulty of the condition attached  the difficulty was not of course in letting her off easy but in qualifying that indulgence  i simply wont qualify it i said to myself  i didnt admire her but i liked her and i had known her so long that i almost felt heartless in sitting down at such an hour to a feast of indifference  i must have seemed abstracted for the early years of my acquaintance with her came back to me  i spoke of her to the lady i had taken down hut the lady i had taken down had never heard of greville fane  i tried my other neighbour who pronounced her books too vile  i had never thought them very good but i should let her off easier than that  i came away early for the express purpose of driving to ask about her  the journey took time for she lived in the northwest district in the neighbourhood of primrose hill  my apprehension that i should be too late was justified in a fuller sense than i had attached to iti had only feared that the house would be shut up there were lights in the windows and the temperate tinkle of my bell brought a servant immediately to the door but poor mrs stormer had passed into a state in which the resonance of no earthly knocker was to be feared  a lady in the hall hovering behind the servant came forward when she heard my voice  i recognised lady luard but she had mistaken me for the doctor  excuse my appearing at such an hour i said it was the first possible moment after i heard  its all over lady luard replied  dearest mamma  she stood there under the lamp with her eyes on me she was very tall very stiff very cold and always looked as if these things and some others beside in her dress her manner and even her name were an implication that she was very admirable  i had never been able to follow the argument but that is a detail  i expressed briefly and frankly what i felt while the little mottled maidservant flattened herself against the wall of the narrow passage and tried to look detached without looking indifferent  it was not a moment to make a visit and i was on the point of retreating when lady luard arrested me with a queer casual drawling would youawould you perhaps be writing something  i felt for the instant like an interviewer which i was not  but i pleaded guilty to this intention on which she rejoined  im so very gladbut i think my brother would like to see you  i detested her brother but it wasnt an occasion to act this out so i suffered myself to be inducted to my surprise into a small back room which i immediately recognised as the scene during the later years of mrs stormers imperturbable industry  her table was there the battered and blotted accessory to innumerable literary lapses with its contracted space for the arms she wrote only from the elbow down and the confusion of scrappy scribbled sheets which had already become literary remains  leolin was also there smoking a cigarette before the fire and looking impudent even in his grief sincere as it well might have been  to meet him to greet him i had to make a sharp effort for the air that he wore to me as he stood before me was quite that of his mothers murderer  she lay silent for ever upstairsas dead as an unsuccessful book and his swaggering erectness was a kind of symbol of his having killed her  i wondered if he had already with his sister been calculating what they could get for the poor papers on the table but i had not long to wait to learn for in reply to the scanty words of sympathy i addressed him he puffed out  its miserable miserable yes but she has left three books complete his words had the oddest effect they converted the cramped little room into a seat of trade and made the book wonderfully feasible he would certainly get all that could be got for the three  lady luard explained to me that her husband had been with them but had had to go down to the house  to her brother she explained that i was going to write something and to me again she made it clear that she hoped i would do mamma justice  she added that she didnt think this had ever been done  she said to her brother  dont you think there are some things he ought thoroughly to understand and on his instantly exclaiming oh thoroughlythoroughly she went on rather austerely  i mean about mammas birth  yes and her connections leolin added  i professed every willingness and for five minutes i listened but it would be too much to say that i understood  i dont even now but it is not important  my vision was of other matters than those they put before me and while they desired there should be no mistake about their ancestors i became more and more lucid about themselves i got away as soon as possible and walked home through the great dusky empty londonthe best of all conditions for thought  by the time i reached my door my little article was practically composed ready to be transferred on the morrow from the polished plate of fancy  i believe it attracted some notice was thought graceful and was said to be by some one else  i had to be pointed without being lively and it took some tact  but what i said was much less interesting than what i thoughtespecially during the halfhour i spent in my armchair by the fire smoking the cigar i always light before going to bed  i went to sleep there i believe but i continued to moralise about greville fane  i am reluctant to lose that retrospect altogether and this is a dim little memory of it a document not to serve  the dear woman had written a hundred stories but none so curious as her own  when first i knew her she had published halfadozen fictions and i believe i had also perpetrated a novel  she was more than a dozen years older than i but she was a person who always acknowledged her relativity  it was not so very long ago but in london amid the big waves of the present even a near horizon gets hidden  i met her at some dinner and took her down rather flattered at offering my arm to a celebrity  she didnt look like one with her matronly mild inanimate face but i supposed her greatness would come out in her conversation  i gave it all the opportunities i could but i was not disappointed when i found her only a dull kind woman  this was why i liked hershe rested me so from literature  to myself literature was an irritation a torment but greville fane slumbered in the intellectual part of it like a creole in a hammock  she was not a woman of genius but her faculty was so special so much a gift out of hand that i have often wondered why she fell below that distinction  this was doubtless because the transaction in her case had remained incomplete genius always pays for the gift feels the debt and she was placidly unconscious of obligation  she could invent stories by the yard but she couldnt write a page of english she went down to her grave without suspecting that though she had contributed volumes to the diversion of her contemporaries she had not contributed a sentence to the language  this had not prevented bushels of criticism from being heaped upon her head she was worth a couple of columns any day to the weekly papers in which it was shown that her pictures of life were dreadful but her style really charming  she asked me to come and see her and i went  she lived then in montpellier square which helped me to see how dissociated her imagination was from her character  an industrious widow devoted to her daily stint to meeting the butcher and baker and making a home for her son and daughter from the moment she took her pen in her hand she became a creature of passion  she thought the english novel deplorably wanting in that element and the task she had cut out for herself was to supply the deficiency  passion in high life was the general formula of this work for her imagination was at home only in the most exalted circles  she adored in truth the aristocracy and they constituted for her the romance of the world or what is more to the point the prime material of fiction  their beauty and luxury their loves and revenges their temptations and surrenders their immoralities and diamonds were as familiar to her as the blots on her writingtable she was not a belated producer of the old fashionable novel she had a cleverness and a modernness of her own she had freshened up the flyblown tinsel  she turned off plots by the hundred andso far as her flying quill could convey herwas perpetually going abroad  her types her illustrations her tone were nothing if not cosmopolitan she recognised nothing less provincial than european society and her fine folk knew each other and made love to each other from doncaster to bucharest  she had an idea that she resembled balzac and her favourite historical characters were lucien de rubempre and the vidame de pamiers  i must add that when i once asked her who the latter personage was she was unable to tell me  she was very brave and healthy and cheerful very abundant and innocent and wicked  she was clever and vulgar and snobbish and never so intensely british as when she was particularly foreign  this combination of qualities had brought her early success and i remember having heard with wonder and envy of what she got in those days for a novel  the revelation gave me a pang  it was such a proof that practising a totally different style i should never make my fortune  and yet when as i knew her better she told me her real tariff and i saw how rumour had quadrupled it i liked her enough to be sorry  after a while i discovered too that if she got less it was not that i was to get any more  my failure never had what mrs stormer would have called the banality of being relative it was always admirably absolute  she lived at ease however in those daysease is exactly the word though she produced three novels a year  she scorned me when i spoke of difficultyit was the only thing that made her angry  if i hinted that a work of art required a tremendous licking into shape she thought it a pretension and a pose she never recognised the torment of form the furthest she went was to introduce into one of her books in satire her hand was heavy a young poet who was always talking about it  i couldnt quite understand her irritation on this score for she had nothing at stake in the matter  she had a shrewd perception that form in prose at least never recommended any one to the public we were condemned to address and therefore she lost nothing putting her private humiliation aside by not having any  she made no pretence of producing works of art but had comfortable teadrinking hours in which she freely confessed herself a common pastrycook dealing in such tarts and puddings as would bring customers to the shop  she put in plenty of sugar and of cochineal or whatever it is that gives these articles a rich and attractive colour  she had a serene superiority to observation and opportunity which constituted an inexpugnable strength and would enable her to go on indefinitely  it is only real success that wanes it is only solid things that melt greville fanes ignorance of life was a resource still more unfailing than the most approved receipt  on her saying once that the day would come when she should have written herself out i answered  ah you look into fairyland and the fairies love you and they never change  fairyland is always there it always was from the beginning of time and it always will be to the end  theyve given you the key and you can always open the door  with me its different i try in my clumsy way to be in some direct relation to life  oh bother your direct relation to life she used to reply for she was always annoyed by the phrasewhich would not in the least prevent her from using it when she wished to try for style  with no more prejudices than an old sausagemill she would give forth again with patient punctuality any poor verbal scrap that had been dropped into her  i cheered her with saying that the dark day at the end would be for the like of me inasmuch as going in our small way by experience and observation we depended not on a revelation but on a little tiresome process  observation depended on opportunity and where should we be when opportunity failed  one day she told me that as the novelists life was so delightful and during the good years at least such a comfortable support she had these staggering optimisms she meant to train up her boy to follow it  she took the ingenious view that it was a profession like another and that therefore everything was to be gained by beginning young and serving an apprenticeship  moreover the education would be less expensive than any other special course inasmuch as she could administer it herself  she didnt profess to keep a school but she could at least teach her own child  it was not that she was so very clever but she confessed to me as if she were afraid i would laugh at her that he was  i didnt laugh at her for that for i thought the boy sharpi had seen him at sundry times  he was well grown and goodlooking and unabashed and both he and his sister made me wonder about their defunct papa concerning whom the little i knew was that he had been a clergyman  i explained them to myself by suppositions and imputations possibly unjust to the departed so little were they superficially at leastthe children of their mother  there used to be on an easel in her drawingroom an enlarged photograph of her husband done by some horrible posthumous process and draped as to its florid frame with a silken scarf which testified to the candour of greville fanes bad taste  it made him look like an unsuccessful tragedian but it was not a thing to trust  he may have been a successful comedian  of the two children the girl was the elder and struck me in all her younger years as singularly colourless  she was only very long like an undecipherable letter  it was not till mrs stormer came back from a protracted residence abroad that ethel which was this young ladys name began to produce the effect which was afterwards remarkable in her of a certain kind of high resolution  she made one apprehend that she meant to do something for herself  she was longnecked and nearsighted and striking and i thought i had never seen sweet seventeen in a form so hard and high and dry  she was cold and affected and ambitious and she carried an eyeglass with a long handle which she put up whenever she wanted not to see  she had come out as the phrase is immensely and yet i felt as if she were surrounded with a spiked iron railing  what she meant to do for herself was to marry and it was the only thing i think that she meant to do for any one else yet who would be inspired to clamber over that bristling barrier  what flower of tenderness or of intimacy would such an adventurer conceive as his reward  this was for sir baldwin luard to say but he naturally never confided to me the secret  he was a joyless jokeless young man with the air of having other secrets as well and a determination to get on politically that was indicated by his never having been known to commit himselfas regards any proposition whateverbeyond an exclamatory oh  his wife and he must have conversed mainly in prim ejaculations but they understood sufficiently that they were kindred spirits  i remember being angry with greville fane when she announced these nuptials to me as magnificent i remember asking her what splendour there was in the union of the daughter of a woman of genius with an irredeemable mediocrity  oh hes awfully clever she said but she blushed for the maternal fib  what she meant was that though sir baldwins estates were not vast he had a dreary house in south kensington and a still drearier hall somewhere in essex which was let the connection was a smarter one than a child of hers could have aspired to form  in spite of the social bravery of her novels she took a very humble and dingy view of herself so that of all her productions my daughter lady luard was quite the one she was proudest of  that personage thought her mother very vulgar and was distressed and perplexed by the occasional license of her pen but had a complicated attitude in regard to this indirect connection with literature  so far as it was lucrative her ladyship approved of it and could compound with the inferiority of the pursuit by doing practical justice to some of its advantages  i had reason to know my reason was simply that poor mrs stormer told me that she suffered the inky fingers to press an occasional bank note into her palm  on the other hand she deplored the peculiar style to which greville fane had devoted herself and wondered where an author who had the convenience of so ladylike a daughter could have picked up such views about the best society  she might know better with leolin and me lady luard had been known to remark but it appeared that some of greville fanes superstitions were incurable  she didnt live in lady luards society and the best was not good enough for hershe must make it still better  i could see that this necessity grew upon her during the years she spent abroad when i had glimpses of her in the shifting sojourns that lay in the path of my annual ramble  she betook herself from germany to switzerland and from switzerland to italy she favoured cheap places and set up her desk in the smaller capitals  i took a look at her whenever i could and i always asked how leolin was getting on  she gave me beautiful accounts of him and whenever it was possible the boy was produced for my edification  i had entered from the first into the joke of his careeri pretended to regard him as a consecrated child  it had been a joke for mrs stormer at first but the boy himself had been shrewd enough to make the matter serious  if his mother accepted the principle that the intending novelist cannot begin too early to see life leolin was not interested in hanging back from the application of it  he was eager to qualify himself and took to cigarettes at ten on the highest literary grounds  his poor mother gazed at him with extravagant envy and like desdemona wished heaven had made her such a man  she explained to me more than once that in her profession she had found her sex a dreadful drawback  she loved the story of madame george sands early rebellion against this hindrance and believed that if she had worn trousers she could have written as well as that lady leolin had for the career at least the qualification of trousers and as he grew older he recognised its importance by laying in an immense assortment  he grew up in gorgeous apparel which was his way of interpreting his mothers system  whenever i met her i found her still under the impression that she was carrying this system out and that leolins training was bearing fruit  she was giving him experience she was giving him impressions she was putting a gagnepain into his hand  it was another name for spoiling him with the best conscience in the world  the queerest pictures come back to me of this period of the good ladys life and of the extraordinarily virtuous muddled bewildering tenor of it  she had an idea that she was seeing foreign manners as well as her petticoats would allow but in reality she was not seeing anything least of all fortunately how much she was laughed at  she drove her whimsical pen at dresden and at florence and produced in all places and at all times the same romantic and ridiculous fictions  she carried about her box of properties and fished out promptly the familiar tarnished old puppets  she believed in them when others couldnt and as they were like nothing that was to be seen under the sun it was impossible to prove by comparison that they were wrong  you cant compare birds and fishes you could only feel that as greville fanes characters had the fine plumage of the former species human beings must be of the latter  it would have been droll if it had not been so exemplary to see her tracing the loves of the duchesses beside the innocent cribs of her children  the immoral and the maternal lived together in her diligent days on the most comfortable terms and she stopped curling the mustaches of her guardsmen to pat the heads of her babes  she was haunted by solemn spinsters who came to tea from continental pensions and by unsophisticated americans who told her she was just loved in their country  i had rather be just paid there she usually replied for this tribute of transatlantic opinion was the only thing that galled her  the americans went away thinking her coarse though as the author of so many beautiful lovestories she was disappointing to most of these pilgrims who had not expected to find a shy stout ruddy lady in a cap like a crumbled pyramid  she wrote about the affections and the impossibility of controlling them but she talked of the price of pension and the convenience of an english chemist  she devoted much thought and many thousands of francs to the education of her daughter who spent three years at a very superior school at dresden receiving wonderful instruction in sciences arts and tongues and who taking a different line from leolin was to be brought up wholly as a femme du monde  the girl was musical and philological she made a specialty of languages and learned enough about them to be inspired with a great contempt for her mothers artless accents  greville fanes french and italian were droll the imitative faculty had been denied her and she had an unequalled gift especially pen in hand of squeezing big mistakes into small opportunities  she knew it but she didnt care correctness was the virtue in the world that like her heroes and heroines she valued least  ethel who had perceived in her pages some remarkable lapses undertook at one time to revise her proofs but i remember her telling me a year after the girl had left school that this function had been very briefly exercised  she cant read me said mrs stormer i offend her taste  she tells me that at dresdenat schooli was never allowed  the good lady seemed surprised at this having the best conscience in the world about her lucubrations  she had never meant to fly in the face of anything and considered that she grovelled before the rhadamanthus of the english literary tribunal the celebrated and awful young person  i assured her as a joke that she was frightfully indecent she hadnt in fact that reality any more than any other my purpose being solely to prevent her from guessing that her daughter had dropped her not because she was immoral but because she was vulgar  i used to figure her children closeted together and asking each other while they exchanged a gaze of dismay  why should she be soand so fearfully sowhen she has the advantage of our society  shouldnt we have taught her better  then i imagined their recognising with a blush and a shrug that she was unteachable irreformable  indeed she was poor lady but it is never fair to read by the light of taste things that were not written by it  greville fane had in the topsyturvy a serene good faith that ought to have been safe from allusion like a stutter or a faux pas  she didnt make her son ashamed of the profession to which he was destined however she only made him ashamed of the way she herself exercised it  but he bore his humiliation much better than his sister for he was ready to take for granted that he should one day restore the balance  he was a canny and farseeing youth with appetites and aspirations and he had not a scruple in his composition  his mothers theory of the happy knack he could pick up deprived him of the wholesome discipline required to prevent young idlers from becoming cads  he had abroad a casual tutor and a snatch or two of a swiss school but no consecutive study no prospect of a university or a degree  it may be imagined with what zeal as the years went on he entered into the pleasantry of there being no manual so important to him as the massive book of life  it was an expensive volume to peruse but mrs stormer was willing to lay out a sum in what she would have called her premiers frais ethel disapprovedshe thought this education far too unconventional for an english gentleman  her voice was for eton and oxford or for any public school she would have resigned herself with the army to follow  but leolin never was afraid of his sister and they visibly disliked though they sometimes agreed to assist each other  they could combine to work the oracleto keep their mother at her desk  when she came back to england telling me she had got all the continent could give her leolin was a broadshouldered redfaced young man with an immense wardrobe and an extraordinary assurance of manner  she was fondly obstinate about her having taken the right course with him and proud of all that he knew and had seen  he was now quite ready to begin and a little while later she told me he had begun  he had written something tremendously clever and it was coming out in the cheapside  i believe it came out i had no time to look for it i never heard anything about it  i took for granted that if this contribution had passed through his mothers hands it had practically become a specimen of her own genius and it was interesting to consider mrs stormers future in the light of her having to write her sons novels as well as her own  this was not the way she looked at it herself she took the charming ground that he would help her to write hers  she used to tell me that he supplied passages of the greatest value to her own workall sorts of technical things about hunting and yachting and winethat she couldnt be expected to get very straight  it was all so much practice for him and so much alleviation for her  i was unable to identify these pages for i had long since ceased to keep up with greville fane but i was quite able to believe that the winequestion had been put by leolins good offices on a better footing for the dear lady used to mix her drinks she was perpetually serving the most splendid suppers in the queerest fashion  i could see that he was willing enough to accept a commission to look after that department  it occurred to me indeed when mrs stormer settled in england again that by making a shrewd use of both her children she might be able to rejuvenate her style  ethel had come back to gratify her young ambition and if she couldnt take her mother into society she would at least go into it herself  silently stiffly almost grimly this young lady held up her head clenched her long teeth squared her lean elbows and made her way up the staircases she had elected  the only communication she ever made to me the only effusion of confidence with which she ever honoured me was when she said  i dont want to know the people mamma knows i mean to know others  i took due note of the remark for i was not one of the others  i couldnt trace therefore the steps of her process i could only admire it at a distance and congratulate her mother on the results  the results were that ethel went to big parties and got people to take her  some of them were people she had met abroad and others were people whom the people she had met abroad had met  they ministered alike to miss ethels convenience and i wondered how she extracted so many favours without the expenditure of a smile  her smile was the dimmest thing in the world diluted lemonade without sugar and she had arrived precociously at social wisdom recognising that if she was neither pretty enough nor rich enough nor clever enough she could at least in her muscular youth be rude enough therefore if she was able to tell her mother what really took place in the mansions of the great give her notes to work from the quill could be driven at home to better purpose and precisely at a moment when it would have to be more active than ever  but if she did tell it would appear that poor mrs stormer didnt believe  as regards many points this was not a wonder at any rate i heard nothing of greville fanes having developed a new manner  she had only one manner from start to finish as leolin would have said  she was tired at last but she mentioned to me that she couldnt afford to pause  she continued to speak of leolins work as the great hope of their future she had saved no money though the young man wore to my sense an aspect more and more professional if you like but less and less literary  at the end of a couple of years there was something monstrous in the impudence with which he played his part in the comedy  when i wondered how she could play her part i had to perceive that her good faith was complete and that what kept it so was simply her extravagant fondness  she loved the young impostor with a simple blind benighted love and of all the heroes of romance who had passed before her eyes he was by far the most brilliant  he was at any rate the most realshe could touch him pay for him suffer for him worship him  he made her think of her princes and dukes and when she wished to fix these figures in her minds eye she thought of her boy  she had often told me she was carried away by her own creations and she was certainly carried away by leolin  he vivified by potentialities at least the whole question of youth and passion  she held not unjustly that the sincere novelist should feel the whole flood of life she acknowledged with regret that she had not had time to feel it herself and it was a joy to her that the deficiency might be supplied by the sight of the way it was rushing through this magnificent young man  she exhorted him i suppose to let it rush she wrung her own flaccid little sponge into the torrent  i knew not what passed between them in her hours of tuition but i gathered that she mainly impressed on him that the great thing was to live because that gave you material  he asked nothing better he collected material and the formula served as a universal pretext  you had only to look at him to see that with his rings and breastpins his crossbarred jackets his early embonpoint his eyes that looked like imitation jewels his various indications of a dense fullblown temperament his idea of life was singularly vulgar but he was not so far wrong as that his response to his mothers expectations was not in a high degree practical  if she had imposed a profession on him from his tenderest years it was exactly a profession that he followed  the two were not quite the same inasmuch as his was simply to live at her expense but at least she couldnt say that he hadnt taken a line  if she insisted on believing in him he offered himself to the sacrifice  my impression is that her secret dream was that he should have a liaison with a countess and he persuaded her without difficulty that he had one  i dont know what countesses are capable of but i have a clear notion of what leolin was  he didnt persuade his sister who despised himshe wished to work her mother in her own way and i asked myself why the girls judgment of him didnt make me like her better  it was because it didnt save her after all from a mute agreement with him to go halves  there were moments when i couldnt help looking hard into his atrocious young eyes challenging him to confess his fantastic fraud and give it up  not a little tacit conversation passed between us in this way but he had always the best of it  if i said  oh come now with me you neednt keep it up plead guilty and ill let you off he wore the most ingenuous the most candid expression in the depths of which i could read  oh yes i know it exasperates youthats just why i do it  he took the line of earnest inquiry talked about balzac and flaubert asked me if i thought dickens did exaggerate and thackeray ought to be called a pessimist  once he came to see me at his mothers suggestion he declared on purpose to ask me how far in my opinion in the english novel one really might venture to go he was not resigned to the usual pruderieshe suffered under them already  he struck out the brilliant idea that nobody knew how far we might go for nobody had ever tried  did i think he might safely trywould it injure his mother if he did  he would rather disgrace himself by his timidities than injure his mother but certainly some one ought to try  wouldnt i trycouldnt i be prevailed upon to look at it as a duty  surely the ultimate point ought to be fixed he was worried haunted by the question  he patronised me unblushingly made me feel like a foolish amateur a helpless novice inquired into my habits of work and conveyed to me that i was utterly vieux jeu and had not had the advantage of an early training  i had not been brought up from the germ i knew nothing of lifedidnt go at it on his system  he had dipped into french feuilletons and picked up plenty of phrases and he made a much better show in talk than his poor mother who never had time to read anything and could only be vivid with her pen  if i didnt kick him downstairs it was because he would have alighted on her at the bottom  when she went to live at primrose hill i called upon her and found her weary and wasted  it had waned a good deal the elation caused the year before by ethels marriage the foam on the cup had subsided and there was a bitterness in the draught  she had had to take a cheaper house and she had to work still harder to pay even for that  sir baldwin was obliged to be close his charges were fearful and the dream of her living with her daughter a vision she had never mentioned to me must be renounced  i would have helped with things and i could have lived perfectly in one room she said i would have paid for everything andafter all im some one aint i  but i dont fit in and ethel tells me there are tiresome people she must receive  i can help them from here no doubt better than from there  she told me once you know what she thinks of my picture of life  mamma your picture of life is preposterous  no doubt it is but shes vexed with me for letting my prices go down and i had to write three novels to pay for all her marriage cost me  i did it very welli mean the outfit and the wedding but thats why im here  at any rate she doesnt want a dingy old woman in her house  i should give it an atmosphere of literary glory but literary glory is only the eminence of nobodies besides she doubts my gloryshe knows im glorious only at peckham and hackney  she doesnt want her friends to ask if ive never known nice people  she cant tell them ive never been in society  she tried to teach me better once but i couldnt learn  it would seem too as if peckham and hackney had had enough of me for dont tell any one ive had to take less for my last than i ever took for anything  i asked her how little this had been not from curiosity but in order to upbraid her more disinterestedly than lady luard had done for such concessions  she answered im ashamed to tell you and then she began to cry  i had never seen her break down and i was proportionately moved she sobbed like a frightened child over the extinction of her vogue and the exhaustion of her vein  her little workroom seemed indeed a barren place to grow flowers and i wondered in the after years for she continued to produce and publish by what desperate and heroic process she dragged them out of the soil  i remember asking her on that occasion what had become of leolin and how much longer she intended to allow him to amuse himself at her cost  she rejoined with spirit wiping her eyes that he was down at brighton hard at workhe was in the midst of a noveland that he felt life so in all its misery and mystery that it was cruel to speak of such experiences as a pleasure  he goes beneath the surface she said and he forces himself to look at things from which he would rather turn away  do you call that amusing yourself  you should see his face sometimes  and he does it for me as much as for himself  he tells me everythinghe comes home to me with his trouvailles  we are artists together and to the artist all things are pure  ive often heard you say so yourself  the novel that leolin was engaged in at brighton was never published but a friend of mine and of mrs stormers who was staying there happened to mention to me later that he had seen the young apprentice to fiction driving in a dogcart a young lady with a very pink face  when i suggested that she was perhaps a woman of title with whom he was conscientiously flirting my informant replied  she is indeed but do you know what her title is  he pronounced itit was familiar and descriptivebut i wont reproduce it here  i dont know whether leolin mentioned it to his mother  she would have needed all the purity of the artist to forgive him  i hated so to come across him that in the very last years i went rarely to see her though i knew that she had come pretty well to the end of her rope  i didnt want her to tell me that she had fairly to give her books awayi didnt want to see her cry  she kept it up amazingly and every few months at my club i saw three new volumes in green in crimson in blue on the book table that groaned with light literature  once i met her at the academy soiree where you meet people you thought were dead and she vouchsafed the information as if she owed it to me in candour that leolin had been obliged to recognise insuperable difficulties in the question of form he was so fastidious so that she had now arrived at a definite understanding with him it was such a comfort that she would do the form if he would bring home the substance  that was now his positionhe foraged for her in the great world at a salary hes my devil dont you see as if i were a great lawyer  he gets up the case and i argue it  she mentioned further that in addition to his salary he was paid by the piece  he got so much for a striking character so much for a pretty name so much for a plot so much for an incident and had so
