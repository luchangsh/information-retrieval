                                hawthorne   chapter i  early years   it will be necessary for several reasons to give this short sketch the form rather of a critical essay than of a biography the data for a life of nathaniel hawthorne are the reverse of copious and even if they were abundant they would serve but in a limited measure the purpose of the biographer hawthornes career was probably as tranquil and uneventful a one as ever fell to the lot of a man of letters it was almost strikingly deficient in incident in what may be called the dramatic quality few men of equal genius and of equal eminence can have led on the whole a simpler life his six volumes of notebooks illustrate this simplicity they are a sort of monument to an unagitated fortune hawthornes career had few vicissitudes or variations it was passed for the most part in a small and homogeneous society in a provincial rural community it had few perceptible points of contact with what is called the world with public events with the manners of his time even with the life of his neighbours its literary incidents are not numerous he produced in quantity but little his works consist of four novels and the fragment of another five volumes of short tales a collection of sketches and a couple of storybooks for children and yet some account of the man and the writer is well worth giving whatever may have been hawthornes private lot he has the importance of being the most beautiful and most eminent representative of a literature the importance of the literature may be questioned but at any rate in the field of letters hawthorne is the most valuable example of the american genius that genius has not as a whole been literary but hawthorne was on his limited scale a master of expression he is the writer to whom his countrymen most confidently point when they wish to make a claim to have enriched the mothertongue and judging from present appearances he will long occupy this honourable position if there is something very fortunate for him in the way that he borrows an added relief from the absence of competitors in his own line and from the general flatness of the literary field that surrounds him there is also to a spectator something almost touching in his situation he was so modest and delicate a genius that we may fancy him appealing from the lonely honour of a representative attitudeperceiving a painful incongruity between his imponderable literary baggage and the large conditions of american life hawthorne on the one side is so subtle and slender and unpretending and the american world on the other is so vast and various and substantial that it might seem to the author of the scarlet letter and the mosses from an old manse that we render him a poor service in contrasting his proportions with those of a great civilization but our author must accept the awkward as well as the graceful side of his fame for he has the advantage of pointing a valuable moral this moral is that the flower of art blooms only where the soil is deep that it takes a great deal of history to produce a little literature that it needs a complex social machinery to set a writer in motion american civilization has hitherto had other things to do than to produce flowers and before giving birth to writers it has wisely occupied itself with providing something for them to write about three or four beautiful talents of transatlantic growth are the sum of what the world usually recognises and in this modest nosegay the genius of hawthorne is admitted to have the rarest and sweetest fragrance  his very simplicity has been in his favour it has helped him to appear complete and homogeneous to talk of his being national would be to force the note and make a mistake of proportion but he is in spite of the absence of the realistic quality intensely and vividly local out of the soil of new england he sprangin a crevice of that immitigable granite he sprouted and bloomed half of the interest that he possesses for an american reader with any turn for analysis must reside in his latent new england savour and i think it no more than just to say that whatever entertainment he may yield to those who know him at a distance it is an almost indispensable condition of properly appreciating him to have received a personal impression of the manners the morals indeed of the very climate of the great region of which the remarkable city of boston is the metropolis the cold bright air of new england seems to blow through his pages and these in the opinion of many people are the medium in which it is most agreeable to make the acquaintance of that tonic atmosphere as to whether it is worth while to seek to know something of new england in order to extract a more intimate quality from the house of seven gables and the blithedale romance i need not pronounce but it is certain that a considerable observation of the society to which these productions were more directly addressed is a capital preparation for enjoying them i have alluded to the absence in hawthorne of that quality of realism which is now so much in fashion an absence in regard to which there will of course be more to say and yet i think i am not fanciful in saying that he testifies to the sentiments of the society in which he flourished almost as pertinently proportions observed as balzac and some of his descendantsmm flaubert and zolatestify to the manners and morals of the french people he was not a man with a literary theory he was guiltless of a system and i am not sure that he had ever heard of realism this remarkable compound having although it was invented some time earlier come into general use only since his death he had certainly not proposed to himself to give an account of the social idiosyncrasies of his fellowcitizens for his touch on such points is always light and vague he has none of the apparatus of an historian and his shadowy style of portraiture never suggests a rigid standard of accuracy nevertheless he virtually offers the most vivid reflection of new england life that has found its way into literature his value in this respect is not diminished by the fact that he has not attempted to portray the usual yankee of comedy and that he has been almost culpably indifferent to his opportunities for commemorating the variations of colloquial english that may be observed in the new world his characters do not express themselves in the dialect of the biglow paperstheir language indeed is apt to be too elegant too delicate they are not portraits of actual types and in their phraseology there is nothing imitative but none the less hawthornes work savours thoroughly of the local soilit is redolent of the social system in which he had his being  this could hardly fail to be the case when the man himself was so deeply rooted in the soil hawthorne sprang from the primitive new england stock he had a very definite and conspicuous pedigree he was born at salem massachusetts on the 4th of july 1804 and his birthday was the great american festival the anniversary of the declaration of national independence1 hawthorne was in his disposition an unqualified and unflinching american he found occasion to give us the measure of the fact during the seven years that he spent in europe toward the close of his life and this was no more than proper on the part of a man who had enjoyed the honour of coming into the world on the day on which of all the days in the year the great republic enjoys her acutest fit of selfconsciousness moreover a person who has been ushered into life by the ringing of bells and the booming of cannon unless indeed he be frightened straight out of it again by the uproar of his awakening receives by this very fact an injunction to do something great something that will justify such striking natal accompaniments hawthorne was by race of the clearest puritan strain his earliest american ancestors who wrote the name hathornethe shape in which it was transmitted to nathaniel who inserted the w was the younger son of a wiltshire family whose residence according to a note of our authors in 1837 was wigcastle wigton hawthorne in the note in question mentions the gentleman who was at that time the head of the family but it does not appear that he at any period renewed acquaintance with his english kinsfolk major william hathorne came out to massachusetts in the early years of the puritan settlement in 1635 or 1636 according to the note to which i have just alluded in 1630 according to information presumably more accurate he was one of the band of companions of the virtuous and exemplary john winthrop the almost lifelong royal governor of the young colony and the brightest and most amiable figure in the early puritan annals how amiable william hathorne may have been i know not but he was evidently of the stuff of which the citizens of the commonwealth were best advised to be made he was a sturdy fighting man doing solid execution upon both the inward and outward enemies of the state the latter were the savages the former the quakers the energy expended by the early puritans in resistance to the tomahawk not weakening their disposition to deal with spiritual dangers they employed the sameor almost the sameweapons in both directions the flintlock and the halberd against the indians and the catoninetails against the heretics one of the longest though by no means one of the most successful of hawthornes shorter tales the gentle boy deals with this pitiful persecution of the least aggressive of all schismatic bodies william hathorne who had been made a magistrate of the town of salem where a grant of land had been offered him as an inducement to residence figures in new england history as having given orders that anne coleman and four of her friends should be whipped through salem boston and dedham this anne coleman i suppose is the woman alluded to in that fine passage in the introduction to the scarlet letter in which hawthorne pays a qualified tribute to the founder of the american branch of his race       the figure of that first ancestor invested by family      tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur was present to my      boyish imagination as far back as i can remember it still      haunts me and induces a sort of homefeeling with the past      which i scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of      the town i seem to have a stronger claim to a residence      here on account of this grave bearded sablecloaked and      steeplecrowned progenitorwho came so early with his      bible and his sword and trod the unworn street with such a      stately port and make so large a figure as a man of war and      peacea stronger claim than for myself whose name is      seldom heard and my face hardly known he was a soldier      legislator judge he was a ruler in the church he had all      the puritanic traits both good and evil he was likewise a      bitter persecutor as witness the quakers who have      remembered him in their histories and relate an incident of      his hard severity towards a woman of their sect which will      last longer it is to be feared than any of his better      deeds though these were many  footnotes  footnote 1 it is proper that before i go further i should acknowledge my large obligations to the only biography of our author of any considerable length that has been writtenthe little volume entitled a study of hawthorne by mr george parsons lathrop the soninlaw of the subject of the work boston 1876 to this ingenious and sympathetic sketch in which the author has taken great pains to collect the more interesting facts of hawthornes life i am greatly indebted mr lathrops work is not pitched in the key which many another writer would have chosen and his tone is not to my sense the truly critical one but without the help afforded by his elaborate essay the present little volume could not have been prepared  william hathorne died in 1681 but those hard qualities that his descendant speaks of were reproduced in his son john who bore the title of colonel and who was connected too intimately for his honour with that deplorable episode of new england history the persecution ofthe socalled witches of salem john hathorne is introduced into the little drama entitled the salem farms in longfellows new england tragedies i know not whether he had the compensating merits of his father but our author speaks of him in the continuation of the passage i have just quoted as having made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches that their blood may be said to have left a stain upon him so deep a stain indeed hawthorne adds characteristically that his old dry bones in the charter street burialground must still retain it if they have not crumbled utterly to dust readers of the house of the seven gables will remember that the story concerns itself with a family which is supposed to be overshadowed by a curse launched against one of its earlier members by a poor man occupying a lowlier place in the world whom this illadvised ancestor had been the means of bringing to justice for the crime of witchcraft hawthorne apparently found the idea of the history of the pyncheons in his own family annals his witchjudging ancestor was reported to have incurred a malediction from one of his victims in consequence of which the prosperity of the race faded utterly away i know not the passage i have already quoted goes on whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelties or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state of being at all events i the present writer hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes and pray that any curse incurred by themas i have heard and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race for some time back would argue to existmay be now and henceforth removed the two first american hathornes had been people of importance and responsibility but with the third generation the family lapsed into an obscurity from which it emerged in the very person of the writer who begs so gracefully for a turn in its affairs it is very true hawthorne proceeds in the introduction to the scarlet letter that from the original point of view such lustre as he might have contrived to confer upon the name would have appeared more than questionable       either of these stern and blackbrowed puritans would have      thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that      after so long a lapse of years the old trunk of the family      tree with so much venerable moss upon it should have      borne as its topmost bough an idler like myself no aim      that i have ever cherished would they recognise as laudable      no success of mine if my life beyond its domestic scope      had ever been brightened by success would they deem      otherwise than worthless if not positively disgraceful      what is he murmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to      the other a writer of storybooks what kind of a business      in life what manner of glorifying god or being serviceable      to mankind in his day and generation may that be why the      degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler such      are the compliments bandied between my great grandsires and      myself across the gulf of time and yet let them scorn me      as they will strong traits of their nature have intertwined      themselves with mine  in this last observation we may imagine that there was not a little truth poet and novelist as hawthorne was sceptic and dreamer and little of a man of action latecoming fruit of a tree which might seem to have lost the power to bloom he was morally in an appreciative degree a chip of the old block his forefathers had crossed the atlantic for conscience sake and it was the idea of the urgent conscience that haunted the imagination of their socalled degenerate successor the puritan strain in his blood ran clearthere are passages in his diaries kept during his residence in europe which might almost have been written by the grimmest of the old salem worthies to him as to them the consciousness of sin was the most importunate fact of life and if they had undertaken to write little tales this baleful substantive with its attendant adjective could hardly have been more frequent in their pages than in those of their fanciful descendant hawthorne had moreover in his composition contemplator and dreamer as he was an element of simplicity and rigidity a something plain and masculine and sensible which might have kept his blackbrowed grandsires on better terms with him than he admits to be possible however little they might have appreciated the artist they would have approved of the man the play of hawthornes intellect was light and capricious but the man himself was firm and rational the imagination was profane but the temper was not degenerate  the dreary and unprosperous condition that he speaks of in regard to the fortunes of his family is an allusion to the fact that several generations followed each other on the soil in which they had been planted that during the eighteenth century a succession of hathornes trod the simple streets of salem without ever conferring any especial lustre upon the town or receiving presumably any great delight from it a hundred years of salem would perhaps be rather a deadweight for any family to carry and we venture to imagine that the hathornes were dull and depressed they did what they could however to improve their situation they trod the salem streets as little as possible they went to sea and made long voyages seamanship became the regular profession of the family hawthorne has said it in charming language from father to son for above a hundred years they followed the sea a greyheaded shipmaster in each generation retiring from the quarterdeck to the homestead while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast confronting the salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire the boy also in due time passed from the forecastle to the cabin spent a tempestuous manhood and returned from his worldwanderings to grow old and die and mingle his dust with the natal earth our authors grandfather daniel hathorne is mentioned by mr lathrop his biographer and soninlaw as a hardy privateer during the war of independence his father from whom he was named was also a shipmaster and he died in foreign lands in the exercise of his profession he was carried off by a fever at surinam in 1808 he left three children of whom nathaniel was the only boy the boys mother who had been a miss manning came of a new england stock almost as longestablished as that of her husband she is described by our authors biographer as a woman of remarkable beauty and by an authority whom he quotes as being a minute observer of religious festivals of feasts fasts newmoons and sabbaths of feasts the poor lady in her puritanic home can have had but a very limited number to celebrate but of newmoons she may be supposed to have enjoyed the usual and of sabbaths even more than the usual proportion  in quiet provincial salem nathaniel hawthorne passed the greater part of his boyhood as well as many years of his later life mr lathrop has much to say about the ancient picturesqueness of the place and about the mystic influences it would project upon such a mind and character as hawthornes these things are always relative and in appreciating them everything depends upon the point of view mr lathrop writes for american readers who in such a matter as this are very easy to please americans have as a general thing a hungry passion for the picturesque and they are so fond of local colour that they contrive to perceive it in localities in which the amateurs of other countries would detect only the most neutral tints history as yet has left in the united states but so thin and impalpable a deposit that we very soon touch the hard substratum of nature and nature herself in the western world has the peculiarity of seeming rather crude and immature the very air looks new and young the light of the sun seems fresh and innocent as if it knew as yet but few of the secrets of the world and none of the weariness of shining the vegetation has the appearance of not having reached its majority a large juvenility is stamped upon the face of things and in the vividness of the present the past which died so young and had time to produce so little attracts but scanty attention i doubt whether english observers would discover any very striking trace of it in the ancient town of salem still with all respect to a york and a shrewsbury to a toledo and a verona salem has a physiognomy in which the past plays a more important part than the present it is of course a very recent past but one must remember that the dead of yesterday are not more alive than those of a century ago i know not of what picturesqueness hawthorne was conscious in his respectable birthplace i suspect his perception of it was less keen than his biographer assumes it to have been but he must have felt at least that of whatever complexity of earlier life there had been in the country the elmshadowed streets of salem were a recognisable memento he has made considerable mention of the place here and there in his tales but he has nowhere dilated upon it very lovingly and it is noteworthy that in the house of the seven gables the only one of his novels of which the scene is laid in it he has by no means availed himself of the opportunity to give a description of it he had of course a filial fondness for ita deepseated sense of connection with it but he must have spent some very dreary years there and the two feelings the mingled tenderness and rancour are visible in the introduction to the scarlet letter       the old town of salem he writesmy native place      though i have dwelt much away from it both in boyhood and      in maturer yearspossesses or did possess a hold on my      affections the force of which i have never realized during      my seasons of actual residence here indeed so far as the      physical aspect is concerned with its flat unvaried      surface covered chiefly with wooden houses few or none of      which pretend to architectural beauty its irregularity      which is neither picturesque nor quaint but only tame its      long and lazy street lounging wearisomely through the whole      extent of the peninsula with gallows hill and new guinea at      one end and a view of the almshouse at the othersuch      being the features of my native town it would be quite as      reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged      chequerboard  but he goes on to say that he has never divested himself of the sense of intensely belonging to itthat the spell of the continuity of his life with that of his predecessors has never been broken it is no matter that the place is joyless for him that he is weary of the old wooden houses the mud and the dust the dead level of site and sentiment the chill east wind and the chilliest of social atmospheresall these and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine are nothing to the purpose the spell survives and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise there is a very american quality in this perpetual consciousness of a spell on hawthornes part it is only in a country where newness and change and brevity of tenure are the common substance of life that the fact of ones ancestors having lived for a hundred and seventy years in a single spot would become an element of ones morality it is only an imaginative american that would feel urged to keep reverting to this circumstance to keep analysing and cunningly considering it  the salem of today has as new england towns go a physiognomy of its own and in spite of hawthornes analogy of the disarranged draughtboard it is a decidedly agreeable one the spreading elms in its streets the proportion of large square honourablelooking houses suggesting an easy copious material life the little gardens the grassy waysides the open windows the air of space and salubrity and decency and above all the intimation of larger antecedentsthese things compose a picture which has little of the element that painters call depth of tone but which is not without something that they would admit to be style to english eyes the oldest and most honourable of the smaller american towns must seem in a manner primitive and rustic the shabby straggling villagequality appears marked in them and their social tone is not unnaturally inferred to bear the village stamp villagelike they are and it would be no gross incivility to describe them as large respectable prosperous democratic villages but even a village in a great and vigorous democracy where there are no overshadowing squires where the county has no social existence where the villagers are conscious of no superincumbent strata of gentility piled upwards into vague regions of privilegeeven a village is not an institution to accept of more or less graceful patronage it thinks extremely well of itself and is absolute in its own regard salem is a seaport but it is a seaport deserted and decayed it belongs to that rather melancholy group of old coasttowns scattered along the great seaface of new england and of which the list is completed by the names of portsmouth plymouth new bedford newburyport newportsuperannuated centres of the traffic with foreign lands which have seen their trade carried away from them by the greater cities as hawthorne says their ventures have gone to swell needlessly and imperceptibly the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston salem at the beginning of the present century played a great part in the eastern trade it was the residence of enterprising shipowners who despatched their vessels to indian and chinese seas it was a place of large fortunes many of which have remained though the activity that produced them has passed away these successful traders constituted what hawthorne calls the aristocratic class he alludes in one of his slighter sketches the sister years to the sway of this class and the moral influence of wealth having been more marked in salem than in any other new england town the sway we may believe was on the whole gently exercised and the moral influence of wealth was not exerted in the cause of immorality hawthorne was probably but imperfectly conscious of an advantage which familiarity had made stalethe fact that he lived in the most democratic and most virtuous of modern communities of the virtue it is but civil to suppose that his own family had a liberal share but not much of the wealth apparently came into their way hawthorne was not born to a patrimony and his income later in life never exceeded very modest proportions  of his childish years there appears to be nothing very definite to relate though his biographer devotes a good many graceful pages to them there is a considerable sameness in the behaviour of small boys and it is probable that if we were acquainted with the details of our authors infantine career we should find it to be made up of the same pleasures and pains as that of many ingenuous lads for whom fame has had nothing in keeping  the absence of precocious symptoms of genius is on the whole more striking in the lives of men who have distinguished themselves than their juvenile promise though it must be added that mr lathrop has made out as he was almost in duty bound to do a very good case in favour of hawthornes having been an interesting child he was not at any time what would be called a sociable man and there is therefore nothing unexpected in the fact that he was fond of long walks in which he was not known to have had a companion juvenile literature was but scantily known at that time and the enormous and extraordinary contribution made by the united states to this department of human happiness was locked in the bosom of futurity the young hawthorne therefore like many of his contemporaries was constrained to amuse himself for want of anything better with the pilgrims progress and the faery queen a boy may have worse company than bunyan and spenser and it is very probable that in his childish rambles our author may have had associates of whom there could be no record when he was nine years old he met with an accident at school which threatened for a while to have serious results he was struck on the foot by a ball and so severely lamed that he was kept at home for a long time and had not completely recovered before his twelfth year his school it is to be supposed was the common dayschool of new englandthe primary factor in that extraordinarily pervasive system of instruction in the plainer branches of learning which forms one of the principal ornaments of american life in 1818 when he was fourteen years old he was taken by his mother to live in the house of an uncle her brother who was established in the town of raymond near lake sebago in the state of maine the immense state of maine in the year 1818 must have had an even more magnificently natural character than it possesses at the present day and the uncles dwelling in consequence of being in a little smarter style than the primitive structures that surrounded it was known by the villagers as mannings folly mr lathrop pronounces this region to be of a weird and woodsy character and hawthorne later in life spoke of it to a friend as the place where i first got my cursed habits of solitude the outlook indeed for an embryonic novelist would not seem to have been cheerful the social dreariness of a small new england community lost amid the forests of maine at the beginning of the present century must have been consummate but for a boy with a relish for solitude there were many natural resources and we can understand that hawthorne should in after years have spoken very tenderly of this episode i lived in maine like a bird of the air so perfect was the freedom i enjoyed during the long summer days he roamed gun in hand through the great woods and during the moonlight nights of winter says his biographer quoting another informant he would skate until midnight all alone upon sebago lake with the deep shadows of the icy hills on either hand  in 1819 he was sent back to salem to school and in the following year he wrote to his mother who had remained at raymond the boy had found a home at salem with another uncle i have left school and have begun to fit for college under benjm l oliver lawyer so you are in danger of having one learned man in your family i get my lessons at home and recite them to him mr oliver at seven oclock in the morning shall you want me to be a minister doctor or lawyer a minister i will not be he adds at the close of this epistleo how i wish i was again with you with nothing to do but to go agunning but the happiest days of my life are gone in 1821 in his seventeenth year he entered bowdoin college at brunswick maine this institution was in the year 1821a quarter of a century after its foundationa highly honourable but not a very elaborately organized nor a particularly impressive seat of learning i say it was not impressive but i immediately remember that impressions depend upon the minds receiving them and that to a group of simple new england lads upwards of sixty years ago the halls and groves of bowdoin neither dense nor lofty though they can have been may have seemed replete with academic stateliness it was a homely simple frugal country college of the oldfashioned american stamp exerting within its limits a civilizing influence working amid the forests and the lakes the loghouses and the clearings toward the amenities and humanities and other collegiate graces and offering a very sufficient education to the future lawyers merchants clergymen politicians and editors of the very active and knowledgeloving community that supported it it did more than thisit numbered poets and statesmen among its undergraduates and on the rollcall of its sons it has several distinguished names among hawthornes fellowstudents was henry wadsworth longfellow who divides with our author the honour of being the most distinguished of american men of letters i know not whether mr longfellow was especially intimate with hawthorne at this period they were very good friends later in life but with two of his companions he formed a friendship which lasted always one of these was franklin pierce who was destined to fill what hawthorne calls the most august position in the world pierce was elected president of the united states in 1852 the other was horatio bridge who afterwards served with distinction in the navy and to whom the charming prefatory letter of the collection of tales published under the name of the snow image is addressed if anybody is responsible at this day for my being an author it is yourself i know not whence your faith came but while we were lads together at a country collegegathering blueberries in studyhours under those tall academic pines or watching the great logs as they tumbled along the current of the androscoggin or shooting pigeons and grey squirrels in the woods or batfowling in the summer twilight or catching trout in that shadowy little stream which i suppose is still wandering riverward through the forestthough you and i will never cast a line in it againtwo idle lads in short as we need not fear to acknowledge now doing a hundred things the faculty never heard of or else it had been worse for usstill it was your prognostic of your friends destiny that he was to be a writer of fiction that is a very pretty picture but it is a picture of happy urchins at school rather than of undergraduates panting as macaulay says for one and twenty poor hawthorne was indeed thousands of miles away from oxford and cambridge that touch about the blueberries and the logs on the androscoggin tells the whole story and strikes the note as it were of his circumstances but if the pleasures at bowdoin were not expensive so neither were the penalties the amount of hawthornes collegiate bill for one term was less than 4l and of this sum more than 9s was made up of fines the fines however were not heavy mr lathrop prints a letter addressed by the president to mrs elizabeth c hathorne requesting her cooperation with the officers of this college in the attempt to induce your son faithfully to observe the laws of this institution he has just been fined fifty cents for playing cards for money during the preceding term perhaps he might not have gamed the professor adds were it not for the influence of a student whom we have dismissed from college the biographer quotes a letter from hawthorne to one of his sisters in which the writer says in allusion to this remark that it is a great mistake to think that he has been led away by the wicked ones i was fully as willing to play as the person he suspects of having enticed me and would have been influenced by no one i have a great mind to commence playing again merely to show him that i scorn to be seduced by another into anything wrong there is something in these few words that accords with the impression that the observant reader of hawthorne gathers of the personal character that underlay his duskilysportive imaginationan impression of simple manliness and transparent honesty  he appears to have been a fair scholar but not a brilliant one and it is very probable that as the standard of scholarship at bowdoin was not high he graduated none the less comfortably on this account mr lathrop is able to testify to the fact by no means a surprising one that he wrote verses at college though the few stanzas that the biographer quotes are not such as to make us especially regret that his rhyming mood was a transient one      the ocean hath its silent caves        deep quiet and alone     though there be fury on the waves        beneath them there is none  that quatrain may suffice to decorate our page and in connection with his college days i may mention his first novel a short romance entitled fanshawe which was published in boston in 1828 three years after he graduated it was probably also written after that event but the scene of the tale is laid at bowdoin which figures under an altered name and hawthornes attitude with regard to the book even shortly after it was published was such as to assign it to this boyish period it was issued anonymously but he so repented of his venture that he annihilated the edition of which according to mr lathrop not half a dozen copies are now known to be extant i have seen none of these rare volumes and i know nothing of fanshawe but what the writer just quoted relates it is the story of a young lady who goes in rather an odd fashion to reside at harley college equivalent of bowdoin under the care and guardianship of dr melmoth the president of the institution a venerable amiable unworldly and henpecked scholar here she becomes very naturally an object of interest to two of the students in regard to whom i cannot do better than quote mr lathrop one of these young men is edward wolcott a wealthy handsome generous healthy young fellow from one of the seaport towns and the other fanshawe the hero who is a poor but ambitious recluse already passing into a decline through overmuch devotion to books and meditation fanshawe though the deeper nature of the two and intensely moved by his new passion perceiving that a union between himself and ellen could not be a happy one resigns the hope of it from the beginning but circumstances bring him into intimate relation with her the real action of the book after the preliminaries takes up only some three days and turns upon the attempt of a man named butler to entice ellen away under his protection then marry her and secure the fortune to which she is heiress this scheme is partly frustrated by circumstances and butlers purpose towards ellen thus becomes a much more sinister one from this she is rescued by fanshawe and knowing that he loves her but is concealing his passion she gives him the opportunity and the right to claim her hand for a moment the rush of desire and hope is so great that he hesitates then he refuses to take advantage of her generosity and parts with her for a last time ellen becomes engaged to wolcott who had won her heart from the first and fanshawe sinking into rapid consumption dies before his class graduates the story must have had a good deal of innocent lightness and it is a proof of how little the world of observation lay open to hawthorne at this time that he should have had no other choice than to make his little drama go forward between the rather naked walls of bowdoin where the presence of his heroine was an essential incongruity he was twentyfour years old but the world in its social sense had not disclosed itself to him he had however already at moments a very pretty writers touch as witness this passage quoted by mr lathrop and which is worth transcribing the heroine has gone off with the nefarious butler and the good dr melmoth starts in pursuit of her attended by young wolcott       alas youth these are strange times observed the      president when a doctor of divinity and an undergraduate      set forth like a knighterrant and his squire in search of      a stray damsel methinks i am an epitome of the church      militant or a new species of polemical divinity pray      heaven however there be no such encounter in store for us      for i utterly forgot to provide myself with weapons       i took some thought for that matter reverend knight      replied edward whose imagination was highly tickled by dr      melmoths chivalrous comparison       aye i see that you have girded on a sword said the      divine but wherewith shall i defend myself my hand being      empty except of this goldenheaded staff the gift of mr      langton       one of these if you will accept it answered edward      exhibiting a brace of pistols will serve to begin the      conflict before you join the battle hand to hand       nay i shall find little safety in meddling with that      deadly instrument since i know not accurately from which      end proceeds the bullet said dr melmoth but were it not      better since we are so well provided with artillery to      betake ourselves in the event of an encounter to some      stone wall or other place of strength       if i may presume to advise said the squire you as      being most valiant and experienced should ride forward      lance in hand your long staff serving for a lance while i      annoy the enemy from afar       like teucer behind the shield of ajax interrupted dr      melmoth or david with his stone and sling no no young      man i have left unfinished in my study a learned treatise      important not only to the present age but to posterity for      whose sake i must take heed to my safety but lo who rides      yonder  on leaving college hawthorne had gone back to live at salem                                          chapter ii  early manhood   the twelve years that followed were not the happiest or most brilliant phase of hawthornes life they strike me indeed as having had an altogether peculiar dreariness they had their uses they were the period of incubation of the admirable compositions which eventually brought him reputation and prosperity but of their actual aridity the young man must have had a painful consciousness he never lost the impression of it mr lathrop quotes a phrase to this effect from one of his letters late in life i am disposed to thank god for the gloom and chill of my early life in the hope that my share of adversity came then when i bore it alone and the same writer alludes to a touching passage in the english notebooks which i shall quote entire       i think i have been happier this christmas 1854 than ever      beforeby my own fireside and with my wife and children      about memore content to enjoy what i have less anxious      for anything beyond it in this life my early life was      perhaps a good preparation for the declining half of life      it having been such a blank that any thereafter would      compare favourably with it for a long long while i have      occasionally been visited with a singular dream and i have      an impression that i have dreamed it ever since i have been      in england it is that i am still at college or      sometimes even at schooland there is a sense that i have      been there unconscionably long and have quite failed to      make such progress as my contemporaries have done and i      seem to meet some of them with a feeling of shame and      depression that broods over me as i think of it even when      awake this dream recurring all through these twenty or      thirty years must be one of the effects of that heavy      seclusion in which i shut myself up for twelve years after      leaving college when everybody moved onward and left me      behind how strange that it should come now when i may call      myself famous and prosperouswhen i am happy too  the allusion here is to a state of solitude which was the young mans positive choice at the timeor into which he drifted at least under the pressure of his natural shyness and reserve he was not expansive he was not addicted to experiments and adventures of intercourse he was not personally in a word what is called sociable the general impression of this silenceloving and shadeseeking side of his character is doubtless exaggerated and in so far as it points to him as a sombre and sinister figure is almost ludicrously at fault he was silent diffident more inclined to hesitate to watch and wait and meditate than to produce himself and fonder on almost any occasion of being absent than of being present this quality betrays itself in all his writings there is in all of them something cold and light and thin something belonging to the imagination alone which indicates a man but little disposed to multiply his relations his points of contact with society if we read the six volumes of notebooks with an eye to the evidence of this unsocial side of his life we find it in sufficient abundance but we find at the same time that there was nothing unamiable or invidious in his shyness and above all that there was nothing preponderantly gloomy the qualities to which the notebooks most testify are on the whole his serenity and amenity of mind they reveal these characteristics indeed in an almost phenomenal degree the serenity the simplicity seem in certain portions almost childlike of brilliant gaiety of high spirits there is little but the placidity and evenness of temper the cheerful and contented view of the things he notes never belie themselves i know not what else he may have written in this copious record and what passages of gloom and melancholy may have been suppressed but as his diaries stand they offer in a remarkable degree the reflection of a mind whose development was not in the direction of sadness a very clever french critic whose fancy is often more lively than his observation is deep m emile montégut writing in the revue des deux mondes in the year 1860 invents for our author the appellation of un romancier pessimiste superficially speaking perhaps the title is a happy one but only superficially pessimism consists in having morbid and bitter views and theories about human nature not in indulging in shadowy fancies and conceits there is nothing whatever to show that hawthorne had any such doctrines or convictions certainly the note of depression of despair of the disposition to undervalue the human race is never sounded in his diaries these volumes contain the record of very few convictions or theories of any kind they move with curious evenness with a charming graceful flow on a level which lies above that of a mans philosophy they adhere with such persistence to this upper level that they prompt the reader to believe that hawthorne had no appreciable philosophy at allno general views that were in the least uncomfortable they are the exhibition of an unperplexed intellect i said just now that the development of hawthornes mind was not towards sadness and i should be inclined to go still further and say that his mind properhis mind in so far as it was a repository of opinions and articles of faithhad no development that it is of especial importance to look into what had a development was his imaginationthat delicate and penetrating imagination which was always at play always entertaining itself always engaged in a game of hide and seek in the region in which it seemed to him that the game could best be playedamong the shadows and substructions the darkbased pillars and supports of our moral nature beneath this movement and ripple of his imaginationas free and spontaneous as that of the sea surfacelay directly his personal affections these were solid and strong but according to my impression they had the place very much to themselves  his innocent reserve then and his exaggerated but by no means cynical relish for solitude imposed themselves upon him in a great measure with a persistency which helped to make the time a tolerably arid oneso arid a one indeed that we have seen that in the light of later happiness he pronounced it a blank but in truth if these were dull years it was not all hawthornes fault his situation was intrinsically poorpoor with a poverty that one almost hesitates to look into when we think of what the conditions of intellectual life of taste must have been in a small new england town fifty years ago and when we think of a young man of beautiful genius with a love of literature and romance of the picturesque of style and form and colour trying to make a career for himself in the midst of them compassion for the young man becomes our dominant sentiment and we see the large dry village picture in perhaps almost too hard a light it seems to me then that it was possibly a blessing for hawthorne that he was not expansive and inquisitive that he lived much to himself and asked but little of his milieu if he had been exacting and ambitious if his appetite had been large and his knowledge various he would probably have found the bounds of salem intolerably narrow but his culture had been of a simple sortthere was little of any other sort to be obtained in america in those days and though he was doubtless haunted by visions of more suggestive opportunities we may safely assume that he was not to his own perception the object of compassion that he appears to a critic who judges him after half a centurys civilization has filtered into the twilight of that earlier time if new england was socially a very small place in those days salem was a still smaller one and if the american tone at large was intensely provincial that of new england was not greatly helped by having the best of it the state of things was extremely natural and there could be now no greater mistake than to speak of it with a redundancy of irony american life had begun to constitute itself from the foundations it had begun to be simply it was at an immeasurable distance from having begun to enjoy i imagine there was no appreciable group of people in new england at that time proposing to itself to enjoy life this was not an undertaking for which any provision had been made or to which any encouragement was offered hawthorne must have vaguely entertained some such design upon destiny but he must have felt that his success would have to depend wholly upon his own ingenuity i say he must have proposed to himself to enjoy simply because he proposed to be an artist and because this enters inevitably into the artists scheme there are a thousand ways of enjoying life and that of the artist is one of the most innocent but for all that it connects itself with the idea of pleasure he proposes to give pleasure and to give it he must first get it where he gets it will depend upon circumstances and circumstances were not encouraging to hawthorne  he was poor he was solitary and he undertook to devote himself to literature in a community in which the interest in literature was as yet of the smallest it is not too much to say that even to the present day it is a considerable discomfort in the united states not to be in business the young man who attempts to launch himself in a career that does not belong to the socalled practical order the young man who has not in a word an office in the businessquarter of the town with his name painted on the door has but a limited place in the social system finds no particular bough to perch upon he is not looked at askance he is not regarded as an idler literature and the arts have always been held in extreme honour in the american world and those who practise them are received on easier terms than in other countries if the tone of the american world is in some respects provincial it is in none more so than in this matter of the exaggerated homage rendered to authorship the gentleman or the lady who has written a book is in many circles the object of an admiration too indiscriminating to operate as an encouragement to good writing there is no reason to suppose that this was less the case fifty years ago but fifty years ago greatly more than now the literary man must have lacked the comfort and inspiration of belonging to a class the best things come as a general thing from the talents that are members of a group every man works better when he has companions working in the same line and yielding the stimulus of suggestion comparison emulation great things of course have been done by solitary workers but they have usually been done with double the pains they would have cost if they had been produced in more genial circumstances the solitary worker loses the profit of example and discussion he is apt to make awkward experiments he is in the nature of the case more or less of an empiric the empiric may as i say be treated by the world as an expert but the drawbacks and discomforts of empiricism remain to him and are in fact increased by the suspicion that is mingled with his gratitude of a want in the public taste of a sense of the proportions of things poor hawthorne beginning to write subtle short tales at salem was empirical enough he was one of at most some dozen americans who had taken up literature as a profession the profession in the united states is still very young and of diminutive stature but in the year 1830 its head could hardly have been seen above ground it strikes the observer of today that hawthorne showed great courage in entering a field in which the honours and emoluments were so scanty as the profits of authorship must have been at that time i have said that in the united states at present authorship is a pedestal and literature is the fashion but hawthornes history is a proof that it was possible fifty years ago to write a great many little masterpieces without becoming known he begins the preface to the twicetold tales by remarking that he was for many years the obscurest man of letters in america when once this work obtained recognition the recognition left little to be desired hawthorne never i believe made large sums of money by his writings and the early profits of these charming sketches could not have been considerable for many of them indeed as they appeared in journals and magazines he had never been paid at all but the honour when once it dawnedand it dawned tolerably early in the authors careerwas never thereafter wanting hawthornes countrymen are solidly proud of him and the tone of mr lathrops study is in itself sufficient evidence of the manner in which an american storyteller may in some cases look to have his eulogy pronounced  hawthornes early attempt to support himself by his pen appears to have been deliberate we hear nothing of those experiments in countinghouses or lawyers offices of which a permanent invocation to the muse is often the inconsequent sequel he began to write and to try and dispose of his writings and he remained at salem apparently only because his family his mother and his two sisters lived there his mother had a house of which during the twelve years that elapsed until 1838 he appears to have been an inmate mr lathrop learned from his surviving sister that after publishing fanshawe he produced a group of short stories entitled seven tales of my native land and that this lady retained a very favourable recollection of the work which her brother had given her to read but it never saw the light his attempts to get it published were unsuccessful and at last in a fit of irritation and despair the young author burned the manuscript  there is probably something autobiographic in the striking little tale of the devil in manuscript they have been offered to seventeen publishers says the hero of that sketch in regard to a pile of his own lucubrations       it would make you stare to read their answers one man      publishes nothing but schoolbooks another has five novels      already under examination another gentleman is just      giving up business on purpose i verily believe to avoid      publishing my book in short of all the seventeen      booksellers only one has vouchsafed even to read my tales      and hea literary dabbler himself i should judgehas the      impertinence to criticise them proposing what he calls vast      improvements and concluding after a general sentence of      condemnation with the definitive assurance that he will not      be concerned on any terms but there does seem to be one      righteous man among these seventeen unrighteous ones and he      tells me fairly that no american publisher will meddle      with an american workseldom if by a known writer and      never if by a new oneunless at the writers risk  but though the seven tales were not printed hawthorne proceeded to write others that were the two collections of the twicetold tales and the snow image are gathered from a series of contributions to the local journals and the annuals of that day to make these three volumes he picked out the things he thought the best some very small part he says of what remains might yet be rummaged out but it would not be worth the trouble among the dingy pages of fifteen or twentyyearsold periodicals or within the shabby morocco covers of faded souvenirs these three volumes represent no large amount of literary labour for so long a period and the author admits that there is little to show for the thought and industry of that portion of his life he attributes the paucity of his productions to a total lack of sympathy at the age when his mind would naturally have been most effervescent he had no incitement to literary effort in a reasonable prospect of reputation or profit nothing but the pleasure itself of composition an enjoyment not at all amiss in its way and perhaps essential to the merit of the work in hand but which in the long run will hardly keep the chill out of a writers heart or the numbness out of his fingers these words occur in the preface attached in 1851 to the second edition of the twicetold tales à propos of which i may say that there is always a charm in hawthornes prefaces which makes one grateful for a pretext to quote from them at this time the scarlet letter had just made his fame and the short tales were certain of a large welcome but the account he gives of the failure of the earlier edition to produce a sensation it had been published in two volumes at four years apart may appear to contradict my assertion that though he was not recognised immediately he was recognised betimes in 1850 when the scarlet letter appeared hawthorne was fortysix years old and this may certainly seem a longdelayed popularity on the other hand it must be remembered that he had not appealed to the world with any great energy the twicetold tales charming as they are do not constitute a very massive literary pedestal as soon as the author resorting to severer measures put forth the scarlet letter the public ear was touched and charmed and after that it was held to the end well it might have been the reader will exclaim but what a grievous pity that the dulness of this same organ should have operated so long as a deterrent and by making hawthorne wait till he was nearly fifty to publish his first novel have abbreviated by so much his productive career the truth is he cannot have been in any very high degree ambitious he was not an abundant producer and there was manifestly a strain of generous indolence in his composition there was a loveable want of eagerness about him let the encouragement offered have been what it might he had waited till he was lapsing from middlelife to strike his first noticeable blow and during the last ten years of his career he put forth but two complete works and the fragment of a third  it is very true however that during this early period he seems to have been very glad to do whatever came to his hand certain of his tales found their way into one of the annuals of the time a publication endowed with the brilliant title of the boston token and atlantic souvenir the editor of this graceful repository was s g goodrich a gentleman who i suppose may be called one of the pioneers of american periodical literature he is better known to the world as mr peter parley a name under which he produced a multitude of popular schoolbooks storybooks and other attempts to vulgarize human knowledge and adapt it to the infant mind this enterprising purveyor of literary wares appears incongruously enough to have been hawthornes earliest protector if protection is the proper word for the treatment that the young author received from him mr goodrich induced him in 1836 to go to boston to edit a periodical in which he was interested the american magazine of useful and entertaining knowledge i have never seen the work in question but hawthornes biographer gives a sorry account of it it was managed by the socalled bewick company which took its name from thomas bewick the english restorer of the art of woodengraving and the magazine was to do his memory honour by his admirable illustrations but in fact it never did any one honour nor brought any one profit it was a penny popular affair containing condensed information about innumerable subjects no fiction and little poetry the woodcuts were of the crudest and most frightful sort it passed through the hands of several editors and several publishers hawthorne was engaged at a salary of five hundred dollars a year but it appears that he got next to nothing and did not stay in the position long hawthorne wrote from boston in the winter of 1836 i came here trusting to goodrichs positive promise to pay me fortyfive dollars as soon as i arrived and he has kept promising from one day to another till i do not see that he means to pay at all i have now broke off all intercourse with him and never think of going near him i dont feel at all obliged to him about the editorship for he is a stockholder and director in the bewick company  and i defy them to get another to do for a thousand dollars what i do for five hundredi make nothing he says in another letter of writing a history or biography before dinner goodrich proposed to him to write a universal history for the use of schools offering him a hundred dollars for his share in the work hawthorne accepted the offer and took a handi know not how large a onein the job his biographer has been able to identify a single phrase as our authors he is speaking of george iv even when he was quite a young man this king cared as much about dress as any young coxcomb he had a great deal of taste in such matters and it is a pity that he was a king for he might otherwise have made an excellent tailor the universal history had a great vogue and passed through hundreds of editions but it does not appear that hawthorne ever received more than his hundred dollars the writer of these pages vividly remembers making its acquaintance at an early stage of his educationa very fat stumpylooking book bound in boards covered with green paper and having in the text very small woodcuts of the most primitive sort he associates it to this day with the names of sesostris and semiramis whenever he encounters them there having been he supposes some account of the conquests of these potentates that would impress itself upon the imagination of a child at the end of four months hawthorne had received but twenty dollarsfour poundsfor his editorship of the american magazine  there is something pitiful in this episode and something really touching in the sight of a delicate and superior genius obliged to concern himself with such paltry undertakings the simple fact was that for a man attempting at that time in america to live by his pen there were no larger openings and to live at all hawthorne had as the phrase is to make himself small this cost him less moreover than it would have cost a more copious and strenuous genius for his modesty was evidently extreme and i doubt whether he had any very ardent consciousness of rare talent he went back to salem and from this tranquil standpoint in the spring of 1837 he watched the first volume of his twicetold tales come into the world he had by this time been living some ten years of his manhood in salem and an american commentator may be excused for feeling the desire to construct from the very scanty material that offers itself a slight picture of his life there i have quoted his own allusions to its dulness and blankness but i confess that these observations serve rather to quicken than to depress my curiosity a biographer has of necessity a relish for detail his business is to multiply points of characterisation mr lathrop tells us that our author had little communication with even the members of his family frequently his meals were brought and left at his locked door and it was not often that the four inmates of the old herbert street mansion met in family circle he never read his stories aloud to his mother and sisters it was the custom in this household for the several members to remain very much by themselves the three ladies were perhaps nearly as rigorous recluses as himself and speaking of the isolation which reigned among them hawthorne once said we do not even live at our house it is added that he was not in the habit of going to church this is not a lively picture nor is that other sketch of his daily habits much more exhilarating in which mr lathrop affirms that though the statement that for several years he never saw the sun is entirely an error yet it is true that he stirred little abroad all day and seldom chose to walk in the town except at night in the dusky hours he took walks of many miles along the coast or else wandered about the sleeping streets of salem these were his pastimes and these were apparently his most intimate occasions of contact with life life on such occasions was not very exuberant as any one will reflect who has been acquainted with the physiognomy of a small new england town after nine oclock in the evening hawthorne however was an inveterate observer of small things and he found a field for fancy among the most trivial accidents there could be no better example of this happy faculty than the little paper entitled night sketches included among the twicetold tales this small dissertation is about nothing at all and to call attention to it is almost to overrate its importance this fact is equally true indeed of a great many of its companions which give even the most appreciative critic a singular feeling of his own indiscretionalmost of his own cruelty they are so light so slight so tenderly trivial that simply to mention them is to put them in a false position the authors claim for them is barely audible even to the most acute listener they are things to take or to leaveto enjoy but not to talk about not to read them would be to do them an injustice to read them is essentially to relish them but to bring the machinery of criticism to bear upon them would be to do them a still greater wrong i must remember however that to carry this principle too far would be to endanger the general validity of the present little worka consummation which it can only be my desire to avert therefore it is that i think it permissible to remark that in hawthorne the whole class of little descriptive effusions directed upon common things to which these justmentioned night sketches belong have a greater charm than there is any warrant for in their substance the charm is made up of the spontaneity the personal quality of the fancy that plays through them its mingled simplicity and subtlety its purity and its bonhomie the night sketches are simply the light familiar record of a walk under an umbrella at the end of a long dull rainy day through the sloppy illpaved streets of a country town where the rare gaslamps twinkle in the large puddles and the blue jars in the druggists window shine through the vulgar drizzle one would say that the inspiration of such a theme could have had no great force and such doubtless was the case but out of the salem puddles nevertheless springs flowerlike a charming and natural piece of prose  i have said that hawthorne was an observer of small things and indeed he appears to have thought nothing too trivial to be suggestive his notebooks give us the measure of his perception of common and casual things and of his habit of converting them into memoranda these notebooks by the waythis seems as good a place as any other to say itare a very singular series of volumes i doubt whether there is anything exactly corresponding to them in the whole body of literature they were publishedin six volumes issued at intervalssome years after hawthornes death and no person attempting to write an account of the romancer could afford to regret that they should have been given to the world there is a point of view from which this may be regretted but the attitude of the biographer is to desire as many documents as possible i am thankful then as a biographer for the notebooks but i am obliged to confess that though i have just reread them carefully i am still at a loss to perceive how they came to be writtenwhat was hawthornes purpose in carrying on for so many years this minute and often trivial chronicle for a person desiring information about him at any cost it is valuable it sheds a vivid light upon his character his habits the nature of his mind but we find ourselves wondering what was its value to hawthorne himself it is in a very partial degree a register of impressions and in a still smaller sense a record of emotions outward objects play much the larger part in it opinions convictions ideas pure and simple are almost absent he rarely takes his notebook into his confidence or commits to its pages any reflections that might be adapted for publicity the simplest way to describe the tone of these extremely objective journals is to say that they read like a series of very pleasant though rather dullish and decidedly formal letters addressed to himself by a man who having suspicions that they might be opened in the post should have determined to insert nothing compromising they contain much that is too futile for things intended for publicity whereas on the other hand as a receptacle of private impressions and opinions they are curiously cold and empty they widen as i have said our glimpse of hawthornes mind i do not say that they elevate our estimate of it but they do so by what they fail to contain as much as by what we find in them our business for the moment however is not with the light that they throw upon his intellect but with the information they offer about his habits and his social circumstances  i know not at what age he began to keep a diary the first entries in the american volumes are of the summer of 1835 there is a phrase in the preface to his novel of transformation which must have lingered in the minds of many americans who have tried to write novels and to lay the scene of them in the western world no author without a trial can conceive of the difficulty of writing a romance about a country where there is no shadow no antiquity no mystery no picturesque and gloomy wrong nor anything but a commonplace prosperity in broad and simple daylight as is happily the case with my dear native land the perusal of hawthornes american notebooks operates as a practical commentary upon this somewhat ominous text it does so at least to my own mind it would be too much perhaps to say that the effect would be the same for the usual english reader an american reads between the lineshe completes the suggestionshe constructs a picture i think i am not guilty of any gross injustice in saying that the picture he constructs from hawthornes american diaries though by no means without charms of its own is not on the whole an interesting one it is characterised by an extraordinary blanknessa curious paleness of colour and paucity of detail hawthorne as i have said has a large and healthy appetite for detail and one is therefore the more struck with the lightness of the diet to which his observation was condemned for myself as i turn the pages of his journals i seem to see the image of the crude and simple society in which he lived i use these epithets of course not invidiously but descriptively if one desire to enter as closely as possible into hawthornes situation one must endeavour to reproduce his circumstances we are struck with the large number of elements that were absent from them and the coldness the thinness the blankness to repeat my epithet present themselves so vividly that our foremost feeling is that of compassion for a romancer looking for subjects in such a field it takes so many things as hawthorne must have felt later in life when he made the acquaintance of the denser richer warmereuropean spectacleit takes such an accumulation of history and custom such a complexity of manners and types to form a fund of suggestion for a novelist if hawthorne had been a young englishman or a young frenchman of the same degree of genius the same cast of mind the same habits his consciousness of the world around him would have been a very different affair however obscure however reserved his own personal life his sense of the life of his fellowmortals would have been almost infinitely more various the negative side of the spectacle on which hawthorne looked out in his contemplative saunterings and reveries might indeed with a little ingenuity be made almost ludicrous one might enumerate the items of high civilization as it exists in other countries which are absent from the texture of american life until it should become a wonder to know what was left no state in the european sense of the word and indeed barely a specific national name no sovereign no court no personal loyalty no aristocracy no church no clergy no army no diplomatic service no country gentlemen no palaces no castles nor manors nor old countryhouses nor parsonages nor thatched cottages nor ivied ruins no cathedrals nor abbeys nor little norman churches no great universities nor public schoolsno oxford nor eton nor harrow no literature no novels no museums no pictures no political society no sporting classno epsom nor ascot some such list as that might be drawn up of the absent things in american lifeespecially in the american life of forty years ago the effect of which upon an english or a french imagination would probably as a general thing be appalling the natural remark in the almost lurid light of such an indictment would be that if these things are left out everything is left out the american knows that a good deal remains what it is that remainsthat is his secret his joke as one may say it would be cruel in this terrible denudation to deny him the consolation of his national gift that american humour of which of late years we have heard so much  but in helping us to measure what remains our authors diaries as i have already intimated would give comfort rather to persons who might have taken the alarm from the brief sketch i have just attempted of what i have called the negative side of the american social situation than to those reminding themselves of its fine compensations hawthornes entries are to a great degree accounts of walks in the country drives in stagecoaches people he met in taverns the minuteness of the things that attract his attention and that he deems worthy of being commemorated is frequently extreme and from this fact we get the impression of a general vacancy in the field of vision sunday evening going by the jail the setting sun kindled up the windows most cheerfully as if there were a bright comfortable light within its darksome stone wall i went yesterday with monsieur s to pick raspberries he fell through an old logbridge thrown over a hollow looking back only his head and shoulders appeared through the rotten logs and among the bushesa shower coming on the rapid running of a little barefooted boy coming up unheard and dashing swiftly past us and showing us the soles of his naked feet as he ran adown the path and up the opposite side in another place he devotes a page to a description of a dog whom he saw running round after its tail in still another he remarks in a paragraph by itselfthe aromatic odor of peatsmoke in the sunny

importance demands admission everything in the notes indicates a simple democratic thinlycomposed society there is no evidence of the writer finding himself in any variety or intimacy of relations with any one or with anything we find a good deal of warrant for believing that if we add that statement of mr lathrops about his meals being left at the door of his room to rural rambles of which an impression of the temporary phases of the local applecrop were the usual and an encounter with an organgrinder or an eccentric dog the rarer outcome we construct a rough image of our authors daily life during the several years that preceded his marriage he appears to have read a good deal and that he must have been familiar with the sources of good english we see from his charming expressive slightly selfconscious cultivated but not too cultivated style yet neither in these early volumes of his notebooks nor in the later is there any mention of his reading there are no literary judgments or impressionsthere is almost no allusion to works or to authors the allusions to individuals of any kind are indeed much less numerous than one might have expected there is little psychology little description of manners we are told by mr lathrop that there existed at salem during the early part of hawthornes life a strong circle of wealthy families which maintained rigorously the distinctions of class and whose entertainments were splendid their manners magnificent this is a rather pictorial way of saying that there were a number of people in the placethe commercial and professional aristocracy as it werewho lived in high comfort and respectability and who in their small provincial way doubtless had pretensions to be exclusive into this delectable company mr lathrop intimates that his hero was free to penetrate it is easy to believe it and it would be difficult to perceive why the privilege should have been denied to a young man of genius and culture who was very goodlooking hawthorne must have been in these days judging by his appearance later in life a strikingly handsome fellow and whose american pedigree was virtually as long as the longest they could show but in fact hawthorne appears to have ignored the good society of his native place almost completely no echo of its conversation is to be found in his tales or his journals such an echo would possibly not have been especially melodious and if we regret the shyness and stiffness the reserve the timidity the suspicion or whatever it was that kept him from knowing what there was to be known it is not because we have any very definite assurance that his gains would have been great still since a beautiful writer was growing up in salem it is a pity that he should not have given himself a chance to commemorate some of the types that flourished in the richest soil of the place like almost all people who possess in a strong degree the storytelling faculty hawthorne had a democratic strain in his composition and a relish for the commoner stuff of human nature thoroughly american in all ways he was in none more so than in the vagueness of his sense of social distinctions and his readiness to forget them if a moral or intellectual sensation were to be gained by it he liked to fraternise with plain people to take them on their own terms and put himself if possible into their shoes his notebooks and even his tales are full of evidence of this easy and natural feeling about all his unconventional fellowmortalsthis imaginative interest and contemplative curiosityand it sometimes takes the most charming and graceful forms commingled as it is with his own subtlety and delicacy his complete exemption from vulgarity it is one of the points in his character which his reader comes most to appreciatethat reader i mean for whom he is not as for some few a dusky and malarious genius  but even if he had had personally as many pretensions as he had few he must in the nature of things have been more or less of a consenting democrat for democracy was the very keystone of the simple social structure in which he played his part the air of his journals and his tales alike are full of the genuine democratic feeling this feeling has by no means passed out of new england life it still flourishes in perfection in the great stock of the people especially in rural communities but it is probable that at the present hour a writer of hawthornes general fastidiousness would not express it quite so artlessly a shrewd gentlewoman who kept a tavern in the town he says in chippings with a chisel was anxious to obtain two or three gravestones for the deceased members of her family and to pay for these solemn commodities by taking the sculptor to board this image of a gentlewoman keeping a tavern and looking out for boarders seems from the point of view to which i allude not at all incongruous it will be observed that the lady in question was shrewd it was probable that she was substantially educated and of reputable life and it is certain that she was energetic these qualities would make it natural to hawthorne to speak of her as a gentlewoman the natural tendency in societies where the sense of equality prevails being to take for granted the high level rather than the low perhaps the most striking example of the democratic sentiment in all our authors tales however is the figure of uncle venner in the house of the seven gables uncle venner is a poor old man in a brimless hat and patched trousers who picks up a precarious subsistence by rendering for a compensation in the houses and gardens of the good people of salem those services that are know in new england as chores he carries parcels splits firewood digs potatoes collects refuse for the maintenance of his pigs and looks forward with philosophic equanimity to the time when he shall end his days in the almshouse but in spite of the very modest place that he occupies in the social scale he is received on a footing of familiarity in the household of the fardescended miss pyncheon and when this ancient lady and her companions take the air in the garden of a summer evening he steps into the estimable circle and mingles the smoke of his pipe with their refined conversation this obviously is rather imaginativeuncle venner is a creation with a purpose he is an original a natural moralist a philosopher and hawthorne who knew perfectly what he was about in introducing himhawthorne always knew perfectly what he was aboutwished to give in his person an example of humorous resignation and of a life reduced to the simplest and homeliest elements as opposed to the fantastic pretensions of the antiquated heroine of the story he wished to strike a certain exclusively human and personal note he knew that for this purpose he was taking a licence but the point is that he felt he was not indulging in any extravagant violation of reality giving in a letter about 1830 an account of a little journey he was making in connecticut he says of the end of a seventeen miles stage that in the evening however i went to a bibleclass with a very polite and agreeable gentleman whom i afterwards discovered to be a strolling tailor of very questionable habits  hawthorne appears on various occasions to have absented himself from salem and to have wandered somewhat through the new england states but the only one of these episodes of which there is a considerable account in the notebooks is a visit that he paid in the summer of 1837 to his old collegemate horatio bridge who was living upon his fathers property in maine in company with an eccentric young frenchman a teacher of his native tongue who was looking for pupils among the northern forests i have said that there was less psychology in hawthornes journals than might have been looked for but there is nevertheless a certain amount of it and nowhere more than in a number of pages relating to this remarkable monsieur s hawthorne intimate as he apparently became with him always calls him monsieur just as throughout all his diaries he invariably speaks of all his friends even the most familiar as mr he confers the prefix upon the unconventional thoreau his fellowwoodsman at concord and upon the emancipated brethren at brook farm these pages are completely occupied with monsieur s who was evidently a man of character with the full complement of his national vivacity there is an elaborate effort to analyse the poor young frenchmans disposition something conscientious and painstaking respectful explicit almost solemn these passages are very curious as a reminder of the absence of the offhand element in the manner in which many americans and many new englanders especially make up their minds about people whom they meet this in turn is a reminder of something that may be called the importance of the individual in the american world which is a result of the newness and youthfulness of society and of the absence of keen competition the individual counts for more as it were and thanks to the absence of a variety of social types and of settled heads under which he may be easily and conveniently pigeonholed he is to a certain extent a wonder and a mystery an englishman a frenchmana frenchman above alljudges quickly easily from his own social standpoint and makes an end of it he has not that rather chilly and isolated sense of moral responsibility which is apt to visit a new englander in such processes and he has the advantage that his standards are fixed by the general consent of the society in which he lives a frenchman in this respect is particularly happy and comfortable happy and comfortable to a degree which i think is hardly to be overestimated his standards being the most definite in the world the most easily and promptly appealed to and the most identical with what happens to be the practice of the french genius itself the englishman is notquite so well off but he is better off than his poor interrogative and tentative cousin beyond the seas he is blessed with a healthy mistrust of analysis and hairsplitting is the occupation he most despises there is always a little of the dr johnson in him and dr johnson would have had woefully little patience with that tendency to weigh moonbeams which in hawthorne was almost as much a quality of race as of genius albeit that hawthorne has paid to boswells hero in the chapter on lichfield and uttoxeter in his volume on england a tribute of the finest appreciation american intellectual standards are vague and hawthornes countrymen are apt to hold the scales with a rather uncertain hand and a somewhat agitated conscience                                          chapter iii  early writings   the second volume of the twicetold tales was published in 1845 in boston and at this time a good many of the stories which were afterwards collected into the mosses from an old manse had already appeared chiefly in the democratic review a sufficiently flourishing periodical of that period in mentioning these things i anticipate but i touch upon the year 1845 in order to speak of the two collections of twicetold tales at once during the same year hawthorne edited an interesting volume the journals of an african cruiser by his friend bridge who had gone into the navy and seen something of distant waters his biographer mentions that even then hawthornes name was thought to bespeak attention for a book and he insists on this fact in contradiction to the idea that his productions had hitherto been as little noticed as his own declaration that he remained for a good many years the obscurest man of letters in america might lead one and has led many people to suppose in this dismal chamber fame was won he writes in salem in 1836 and we find in the notebooks 1840 this singularly beautiful and touching passage       here i sit in my old accustomed chamber where i used to      sit in days gone by here i have written many talesmany      that have been burned to ashes many that have doubtless      deserved the same fate this claims to be called a haunted      chamber for thousands upon thousands of visions have      appeared to me in it and some few of them have become      visible to the world if ever i should have a biographer he      ought to make great mention of this chamber in my memoirs      because so much of my lonely youth was wasted here and here      my mind and character were formed and here i have been glad      and hopeful and here i have been despondent and here i sat      a long long time waiting patiently for the world to know      me and sometimes wondering why it did not know me sooner      or whether it would ever know me at allat least till i      were in my grave and sometimes it seems to me as if i were      already in the grave with only life enough to be chilled      and benumbed but oftener i was happyat least as happy as      i then knew how to be or was aware of the possibility of      being by and by the world found me out in my lonely chamber      and called me forthnot indeed with a loud roar of      acclamation but rather with a still small voiceand forth      i went but found nothing in the world i thought preferable      to my solitude till now and now i begin to understand      why i was imprisoned so many years in this lonely chamber      and why i could never break through the viewless bolts and      bars for if i had sooner made my escape into the world i      should have grown hard and rough and been covered with      earthly dust and my heart might have become callous by rude      encounters with the multitude but living in solitude      till the fulness of time was come i still kept the dew of      my youth and the freshness of my heart i used to think      that i could imagine all passions all feelings and states      of the heart and mind but how little did i know indeed      we are but shadows we are not endowed with real life and      all that seems most real about us is but the thinnest      substance of a dreamtill the heart be touched that touch      creates usthen we begin to bethereby we are beings of      reality and inheritors of eternity  there is something exquisite in the soft philosophy of this little retrospect and it helps us to appreciate it to know that the writer had at this time just become engaged to be married to a charming and accomplished person with whom his union which took place two years later was complete and full of happiness but i quote it more particularly for the evidence it affords that already in 1840 hawthorne could speak of the world finding him out and calling him forth as of an event tolerably well in the past he had sent the first of the twicetold series to his old college friend longfellow who had already laid solidly the foundation of his great poetic reputation and at the time of his sending it had written him a letter from which it will be to our purpose to quote a few lines       you tell me you have met with troubles and changes i know      not what these may have been but i can assure you that      trouble is the next best thing to enjoyment and that there      is no fate in the world so horrible as to have no share in      either its joys or sorrows for the last ten years i have      not lived but only dreamed of living it may be true that      there may have been some unsubstantial pleasures here in the      shade which i might have missed in the sunshine but you      cannot conceive how utterly devoid of satisfaction all my      retrospects are i have laid up no treasure of pleasant      remembrances against old age but there is some comfort in      thinking that future years may be more varied and therefore      more tolerable than the past you give me more credit than      i deserve in supposing that i have led a studious life i      have indeed turned over a good many books but in so      desultory a way that it cannot be called study nor has it      left me the fruits of study i have another great      difficulty in the lack of materials for i have seen so      little of the world that i have nothing but thin air to      concoct my stories of and it is not easy to give a      lifelike semblance to such shadowy stuff sometimes      through a peephole i have caught a glimpse of the real      world and the two or three articles in which i have      portrayed these glimpses please me better than the others  it is more particularly for the sake of the concluding lines that i have quoted this passage for evidently no portrait of hawthorne at this period is at all exact which fails to insist upon the constant struggle which must have gone on between his shyness and his desire to know something of life between what may be called his evasive and his inquisitive tendencies i suppose it is no injustice to hawthorne to say that on the whole his shyness always prevailed and yet obviously the struggle was constantly there he says of his twicetold tales in the preface they are not the talk of a secluded man with his own mind and heart had it been so they could hardly have failed to be more deeply and permanently valuable but his attempts and very imperfectly successful ones to open an intercourse with the world we are speaking here of small things it must be rememberedof little attempts little sketches a little world but everything is relative and this smallness of scale must not render less apparent the interesting character of hawthornes efforts as for the twicetold tales themselves they are an old story now every one knows them a little and those who admire them particularly have read them a great many times the writer of this sketch belongs to the latter class and he has been trying to forget his familiarity with them and ask himself what impression they would have made upon him at the time they appeared in the first bloom of their freshness and before the particular hawthornequality as it may be called had become an established a recognised and valued fact certainly i am inclined to think if one had encountered these delicate dusky flowers in the blossomless garden of american journalism one would have plucked them with a very tender hand one would have felt that here was something essentially fresh and new here in no extraordinary force or abundance but in a degree distinctly appreciable was an original element in literature when i think of it i almost envy hawthornes earliest readers the sensation of opening upon the great carbuncle the seven vagabonds or the threefold destiny in an american annual of forty years ago must have been highly agreeable  among these shorter things it is better to speak of the whole collection including the snow image and the mosses from an old manse at once there are three sorts of tales each one of which has an original stamp there are to begin with the stories of fantasy and allegorythose among which the three i have just mentioned would be numbered and which on the whole are the most original this is the group to which such little masterpieces as malvins burial rappacinis daughter and young goodman brown also belongthese two last perhaps representing the highest point that hawthorne reached in this direction then there are the little tales of new england history which are scarcely less admirable and of which the grey champion the maypole of merry mount and the four beautiful legends of the province house as they are called are the most successful specimens lastly come the slender sketches of actual scenes and of the objects and manners about him by means of which more particularly he endeavoured to open an intercourse with the world and which in spite of their slenderness have an infinite grace and charm among these things a rill from the town pump the village uncle the tollgatherers day the chippings with a chisel may most naturally be mentioned as we turn over these volumes we feel that the pieces that spring most directly from his fancy constitute as i have said putting his four novels aside his most substantial claim to our attention it would be a mistake to insist too much upon them hawthorne was himself the first to recognise that these fitful sketches he says in the preface to the mosses from an old manse with so little of external life about them yet claiming no profundity of purposeso reserved even while they sometimes seem so frankoften but half in earnest and never even when most so expressing satisfactorily the thoughts which they profess to imagesuch trifles i truly feel afford no solid basis for a literary reputation this is very becomingly uttered but it may be said partly in answer to it and partly in confirmation that the valuable element in these things was not what hawthorne put into them consciously but what passed into them without his being able to measure itthe element of simple genius the quality of imagination this is the real charm of hawthornes writingthis purity and spontaneity and naturalness of fancy for the rest it is interesting to see how it borrowed a particular colour from the other faculties that lay near ithow the imagination in this capital son of the old puritans reflected the hue of the more purely moral part of the dusky overshadowed conscience the conscience by no fault of its own in every genuine offshoot of that sombre lineage lay under the shadow of the sense of sin this darkening cloud was no essential part of the nature of the individual it stood fixed in the general moral heaven under which he grew up and looked at life it projected from above from outside a black patch over his spirit and it was for him to do what he could with the black patch there were all sorts of possible ways of dealing with it they depended upon the personal temperament some natures would let it lie as it fell and contrive to be tolerably comfortable beneath it others would groan and sweat and suffer but the dusky blight would remain and their lives would be lives of misery here and there an individual irritated beyond endurance would throw it off in anger plunging probably into what would be deemed deeper abysses of depravity hawthornes way was the best for he contrived by an exquisite process best known to himself to transmute this heavy moral burden into the very substance of the imagination to make it evaporate in the light and charming fumes of artistic production but hawthorne of course was exceptionally fortunate he had his genius to help him nothing is more curious and interesting than this almost exclusively imported character of the sense of sin in hawthornes mind it seems to exist there merely for an artistic or literary purpose he had ample cognizance of the puritan conscience it was his natural heritage it was reproduced in him looking into his soul he found it there but his relation to it was only as one may say intellectual it was not moral and theological he played with it and used it as a pigment he treated it as the metaphysicians say objectively he was not discomposed disturbed haunted by it in the manner of its usual and regular victims who had not the little postern door of fancy to slip through to the other side of the wall it was indeed to his imaginative vision the great fact of mans nature the light element that had been mingled with his own composition always clung to this rugged prominence of moral responsibility like the mist that hovers about the mountain it was a necessary condition for a man of hawthornes stock that if his imagination should take licence to amuse itself it should at least select this grim precinct of the puritan morality for its playground he speaks of the dark disapproval with which his old ancestors in the case of their coming to life would see him trifling himself away as a storyteller but how far more darkly would they have frowned could they have understood that he had converted the very principle of their own being into one of his toys  it will be seen that i am far from being struck with the justice of that view of the author of the twicetold tales which is so happily expressed by the french critic to whom i alluded at an earlier stage of this essay to speak of hawthorne as m emile montégut does as a romancier pessimiste seems to me very much beside the mark he is no more a pessimist than an optimist though he is certainly not much of either he does not pretend to conclude or to have a philosophy of human nature indeed i should even say that at bottom he does not take human nature as hard as he may seem to do his bitterness says m montégut is without abatement and his bad opinion of man is without compensation his little tales have the air of confessions which the soul makes to itself they are so many little slaps which the author applies to our face this it seems to me is to exaggerate almost immeasurably the reach of hawthornes relish of gloomy subjects what pleased him in such subjects was their picturesqueness their rich duskiness of colour their chiaroscuro but they were not the expression of a hopeless or even of a predominantly melancholy feeling about the human soul such at least is my own impression he is to a considerable degree ironicalthis is part of his charmpart even one may say of his brightness but he is neither bitter nor cynicalhe is rarely even what i should call tragical there have certainly been storytellers of a gayer and lighter spirit there have been observers more humorous more hilariousthough on the whole hawthornes observation has a smile in it oftener than may at first appear but there has rarely been an observer more serene less agitated by what he sees and less disposed to call things deeply into question as i have already intimated his notebooks are full of this simple and almost childlike serenity that dusky preoccupation with the misery of human life and the wickedness of the human heart which such a critic as m emile montégut talks about is totally absent from them and if we may suppose a person to have read these diaries before looking into the tales we may be sure that such a reader would be greatly surprised to hear the author described as a disappointed disdainful genius this marked love of cases of conscience says m montégut this taciturn scornful cast of mind this habit of seeing sin everywhere and hell always gaping open this dusky gaze bent always upon a damned world and a nature draped in mourning these lonely conversations of the imagination with the conscience this pitiless analysis resulting from a perpetual examination of ones self and from the tortures of a heart closed before men and open to godall these elements of the puritan character have passed into mr hawthorne or to speak more justly have filtered into him through a long succession of generations this is a very pretty and very vivid account of hawthorne superficially considered and it is just such a view of the case as would commend itself most easily and most naturally to a hasty critic it is all true indeed with a difference hawthorne was all that m montégut says minus the conviction the old puritan moral sense the consciousness of sin and hell of the fearful nature of our responsibilities and the savage character of our taskmasterthese things had been lodged in the mind of a man of fancy whose fancy had straightway begun to take liberties and play tricks with themto judge them heaven forgive him from the poetic and æsthetic point of view the point of view of entertainment and irony this absence of conviction makes the difference but the difference is great  hawthorne was a man of fancy and i suppose that in speaking of him it is inevitable that we should feel ourselves confronted with the familiar problem of the difference between the fancy and the imagination of the larger and more potent faculty he certainly possessed a liberal share no one can read the house of the seven gables without feeling it to be a deeply imaginative work but i am often struck especially in the shorter tales of which i am now chiefly speaking with a kind of small ingenuity a taste for conceits and analogies which bears more particularly what is called the fanciful stamp the finer of the shorter tales are redolent of a rich imagination       had goodman brown fallen asleep in the forest and only      dreamed a wild dream of witchmeeting be it so if you      will but alas it was a dream of evil omen for young      goodman brown a stern a sad a darkly meditative a      distrustful if not a desperate man did he become from the      night of that fearful dream on the sabbathday when the      congregation were singing a holy psalm he could not listen      because an anthem of sin rushed loudly upon his ear and      drowned all the blessed strain when the minister spoke from      the pulpit with power and fervid eloquence and with his      hand on the open bible of the sacred truth of our religion      and of saintlike lives and triumphant deaths and of future      bliss or misery unutterable then did goodman brown grow      pale dreading lest the roof should thunder down upon the      gray blasphemer and his hearers often awaking suddenly at      midnight he shrank from the bosom of faith and at morning      or eventide when the family knelt down at prayer he      scowled and muttered to himself and gazed sternly at his      wife and turned away and when he had lived long and was      borne to his grave a hoary corpse followed by faith an      aged woman and children and grandchildren a goodly      procession besides neighbours not a few they carved no      hopeful verse upon his tombstone for his dying hour was      gloom  there is imagination in that and in many another passage that i might quote but as a general thing i should characterise the more metaphysical of our authors short stories as graceful and felicitous conceits they seem to me to be qualified in this manner by the very fact that they belong to the province of allegory hawthorne in his metaphysical moods is nothing if not allegorical and allegory to my sense is quite one of the lighter exercises of the imagination many excellent judges i know have a great stomach for it they delight in symbols and correspondences in seeing a story told as if it were another and a very different story i frankly confess that i have as a general thing but little enjoyment of it and that it has never seemed to me to be as it were a firstrate literary form it has produced assuredly some firstrate works and hawthorne in his younger years had been a great reader and devotee of bunyan and spenser the great masters of allegory but it is apt to spoil two good thingsa story and a moral a meaning and a form and the taste for it is responsible for a large part of the forciblefeeble writing that has been inflicted upon the world the only cases in which it is endurable is when it is extremely spontaneous when the analogy presents itself with eager promptitude when it shows signs of having been groped and fumbled for the needful illusion is of course absent and the failure complete then the machinery alone is visible and the end to which it operates becomes a matter of indifference there was but little literary criticism in the united states at the time hawthornes earlier works were published but among the reviewers edgar poe perhaps held the scales the highest he at any rate rattled them loudest and pretended more than any one else to conduct the weighingprocess on scientific principles very remarkable was this process of edgar poes and very extraordinary were his principles but he had the advantage of being a man of genius and his intelligence was frequently great his collection of critical sketches of the american writers flourishing in what m taine would call his milieu and moment is very curious and interesting reading and it has one quality which ought to keep it from ever being completely forgotten it is probably the most complete and exquisite specimen of provincialism ever prepared for the edification of men poes judgments are pretentious spiteful vulgar but they contain a great deal of sense and discrimination as well and here and there sometimes at frequent intervals we find a phrase of happy insight imbedded in a patch of the most fatuous pedantry he wrote a chapter upon hawthorne and spoke of him on the whole very kindly and his estimate is of sufficient value to make it noticeable that he should express lively disapproval of the large part allotted to allegory in his talesin defence of which he says however or for whatever object employed there is scarcely one respectable word to be said the deepest emotion he goes on aroused within us by the happiest allegory as allegory is a very very imperfectly satisfied sense of the writers ingenuity in overcoming a difficulty we should have preferred his not having attempted to overcome one thing is clear that if allegory ever establishes a fact it is by dint of overturning a fiction and poe has furthermore the courage to remark that the pilgrims progress is a ludicrously overrated book certainly as a general thing we are struck with the ingenuity and felicity of hawthornes analogies and correspondences the idea appears to have made itself at home in them easily nothing could be better in this respect than the snowimage a little masterpiece or the great carbuncle or doctor heideggers experiment or rappacinis daughter but in such things as the birthmark and the bosomserpent we are struck with something stiff and mechanical slightly incongruous as if the kernel had not assimilated its envelope but these are matters of light impression and there would be a want of tact in pretending to discriminate too closely among things which all in one way or another have a charm the charmthe great charmis that they are glimpses of a great field of the whole deep mystery of mans soul and conscience they are moral and their interest is moral they deal with something more than the mere accidents and conventionalities the surface occurrences of life the fine thing in hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychology and that in his way he tried to become familiar with it this natural yet fanciful familiarity with it this air on the authors part of being a confirmed habitué of a region of mysteries and subtleties constitutes the originality of his tales and then they have the further merit of seeming for what they are to spring up so freely and lightly the author has all the ease indeed of a regular dweller in the moral psychological realm he goes to and fro in it as a man who knows his way his tread is a light and modest one but he keeps the key in his pocket  his little historical stories all seem to me admirable they are so good that you may reread them many times they are not numerous and they are very short but they are full of a vivid and delightful sense of the new england past they have moreover the distinction little tales of a dozen and fifteen pages as they are of being the only successful attempts at historical fiction that have been made in the united states hawthorne was at home in the early new england history he had thumbed its records and he had breathed its air in whatever odd receptacles this somewhat pungent compound still lurked he was fond of it and he was proud of it as any new englander must be measuring the part of that handful of halfstarved fanatics who formed his earliest precursors in laying the foundations of a mighty empire hungry for the picturesque as he always was and not finding any very copious provision of it around him he turned back into the two preceding centuries with the earnest determination that the primitive annals of massachusetts should at least appear picturesque his fancy which was always alive played a little with the somewhat meagre and angular facts of the colonial period and forthwith converted a great many of them into impressive legends and pictures there is a little infusion of colour a little vagueness about certain details but it is very gracefully and discreetly done and realities are kept in view sufficiently to make us feel that if we are reading romance it is romance that rather supplements than contradicts history the early annals of new england were not fertile in legend but hawthorne laid his hands upon everything that would serve his purpose and in two or three cases his version of the story has a great deal of beauty the grey champion is a sketch of less than eight pages but the little figures stand up in the tale as stoutly at the least as if they were propped up on halfadozen chapters by a dryer annalist and the whole thing has the merit of those cabinet pictures in which the artist has been able to make his persons look the size of life hawthorne to say it again was not in the least a realisthe was not to my mind enough of one but there is no genuine lover of the good city of boston but will feel grateful to him for his courage in attempting to recount the traditions of washington street the main thoroughfare of the puritan capital the four legends of the province house are certain shadowy stories which he professes to have gathered in an ancient tavern lurking behind the modern shopfronts of this part of the city the province house disappeared some years ago but while it stood it was pointed to as the residence of the royal governors of massachusetts before the revolution i have no recollection of it but it cannot have been even from hawthornes account of it which is as pictorial as he ventures to make it a very imposing piece of antiquity the writers charming touch however throws a rich brown tone over its rather shallow venerableness and we are beguiled into believing for instance at the close of howes masquerade a story of a strange occurrence at an entertainment given by sir william howe the last of the royal governors during the siege of boston by washington that superstition among other legends of this mansion repeats the wondrous tale that on the anniversary night of britains discomfiture the ghosts of the ancient governors of massachusetts still glide through the province house and last of all comes a figure shrouded in a military cloak tossing his clenched hands into the air and stamping his ironshod boots upon the freestone steps with a semblance of feverish despair but without the sound of a foottramp hawthorne had as regards the two earlier centuries of new england life that faculty which is called nowadays the historic consciousness he never sought to exhibit it on a large scale he exhibited it indeed on a scale so minute that we must not linger too much upon it his vision of the past was filled with definite imagesimages none the less definite that they were concerned with events as shadowy as this dramatic passing away of the last of king georges representatives in his long loyal but finally alienated colony  i have said that hawthorne had become engaged in about his thirtyfifthyear but he was not married until 1842 before this event took place he passed through two episodes which putting his falling in love aside were much the most important things that had yet happened to him they interrupted the painful monotony of his life and brought the affairs of men within his personal experience one of these was moreover in itself a curious and interesting chapter of observation and it fructified in hawthornes memory in one of his best productions how urgently he needed at this time to be drawn within the circle of social accidents a little anecdote related by mr lathrop in connection with his first acquaintance with the young lady he was to marry may serve as an example this young lady became known to him through her sister who had first approached him as an admirer of the twicetold tales as to the authorship of which she had been so much in the dark as to have attributed it first conjecturally to one of the two miss hathornes and the two miss peabodys desiring to see more of the charming writer caused him to be invited to a species of conversazione at the house of one of their friends at which they themselves took care to be punctual several other ladies however were as punctual as they and hawthorne presently arriving and seeing a bevy of admirers where he had expected but three or four fell into a state of agitation which is vividly described by his biographer he stood perfectly motionless but with the look of a sylvan creature on the point of fleeing away he was stricken with dismay his face lost colour and took on a warm paleness  his agitation wasvery great he stood by a table and taking up some small object that lay upon it he found his hand trembling so that he was obliged to lay it down it was desirable certainly that something should occur to break the spell of a diffidence that might justly be called morbid there is another little sentence dropped by mr lathrop in relation to this period of hawthornes life which appears to me worth quoting though i am by no means sure that it will seem so to the reader it has a very simple and innocent air but to a person not without an impression of the early days of culture in new england it will be pregnant with historic meaning the elder miss peabody who afterwards was hawthornes sisterinlaw and who acquired later in life a very honourable american fame as a woman of benevolence of learning and of literary accomplishment had invited the miss hathornes to come to her house for the evening and to bring with them their brother whom she wished to thank for his beautiful tales entirely to her surprise says mr lathrop completing thereby his picture of the attitude of this remarkable family toward societyentirely to her surprise they came she herself opened the door and there before her between his sisters stood a splendidly handsome youth tall and strong with no appearance whatever of timidity but instead an almost fierce determination making his face stern this was his resource for carrying off the extreme inward tremor which he really felt his hostess brought out flaxmans designs for dante just received from professor felton of harvard and the party made an evenings entertainment out of them this last sentence is the one i allude to and were it not for fear of appearing too fanciful i should say that these few words were to the initiated mind an unconscious expression of the lonely frigidity which characterised most attempts at social recreation in the new england world some forty years ago there was at that time a great desire for culture a great interest in knowledge in art in æsthetics together with a very scanty supply of the materials for such pursuits small things were made to do large service and there is something even touching in the solemnity of consideration that was bestowed by the emancipated new england conscience upon little wandering books and prints little echoes and rumours of observation and experience there flourished at that time in boston a very remarkable and interesting woman of whom we shall have more to say miss margaret fuller by name this lady was the apostle of culture of intellectual curiosity and in the peculiarly interesting account of her life published in 1852 by emerson and two other of her friends there are pages of her letters and diaries which narrate her visits to the boston athenæum and the emotions aroused in her mind by turning over portfolios of engravings these emotions were ardent and passionatecould hardly have been more so had she been prostrate with contemplation in the sistine chapel or in one of the chambers of the pitti palace the only analogy i can recall to this earnestness of interest in great works of art at a distance from them is furnished by the great goethes elaborate study of plastercasts and pencildrawings at weimar i mention margaret fuller here because a glimpse of her state of mindher vivacity of desire and poverty of knowledgehelps to define the situation the situation lives for a moment in those few words of mr lathrops the initiated mind as i have ventured to call it has a vision of a little unadorned parlour with the snowdrifts of a massachusetts winter piled up about its windows and a group of sensitive and serious people modest votaries of opportunity fixing their eyes upon a bookful of flaxmans attenuated outlines  at the beginning of the year 1839 he received through political interest an appointment as weigher and gauger in the boston customhouse mr van buren then occupied the presidency and it appears that the democratic party whose successful candidate he had been rather took credit for the patronage it had bestowed upon literary men hawthorne was a democrat and apparently a zealous one even in later years after the whigs had vivified their principles by the adoption of the republican platform and by taking up an honest attitude on the question of slavery his political faith never wavered his democratic sympathies were eminently natural and there would have been an incongruity in his belonging to the other party he was not only by conviction but personally and by association a democrat when in later years he found himself in contact with european civilisation he appears to have become conscious of a good deal of latent radicalism in his disposition he was oppressed with the burden of antiquity in europe and he found himself sighing for lightness and freshness and facility of change but these things are relative to the point of view and in his own country hawthorne cast his lot with the party of conservatism the party opposed to change and freshness the people who found something musty and mouldy in his literary productions would have regarded this quite as a matter of course but we are not obliged to use invidious epithets in describing his political preferences the sentiment that attached him to the democracy was a subtle and honourable one and the author of an attempt to sketch a portrait of him should be the last to complain of this adjustment of his sympathies it falls much more smoothly into his readers conception of him than any other would do and if he had had the perversity to be a republican i am afraid our ingenuity would have been considerably taxed in devising a proper explanation of the circumstance at any rate the democrats gave him a small post in the boston customhouse to which an annual salary of 1200 was attached and hawthorne appears at first to have joyously welcomed the gift the duties of the office were not very congruous to the genius of a man of fancy but it had the advantage that it broke the spell of his cursed solitude as he called it drew him away from salem and threw him comparatively speaking into the world the first volume of the american notebooks contains some extracts from letters written during his tenure of this modest office which indicate sufficiently that his occupations cannot have been intrinsically gratifying       i have been measuring coal all day he writes during the      winter of 1840 on board of a black little british      schooner in a dismal dock at the north end of the city      most of the time i paced the deck to keep myself warm for      the wind northeast i believe blew up through the dock as      if it had been the pipe of a pair of bellows the vessel      lying deep between two wharves there was no more delightful      prospect on the right hand and on the left than the posts      and timbers half immersed in the water and covered with      ice which the rising and falling of successive tides had      left upon them so that they looked like immense icicles      across the water however not more than half a mile off      appeared the bunkers hill monument and what interested me      considerably more a churchsteeple with the dial of a      clock upon it whereby i was enabled to measure the march of      the weary hours sometimes i descended into the dirty little      cabin of the schooner and warmed myself by a redhot stove      among biscuitbarrels pots and kettles seachests and      innumerable lumber of all sortsmy olfactories meanwhile      being greatly refreshed with the odour of a pipe which the      captain or some one of his crew was smoking but at last      came the sunset with delicate clouds and a purple light      upon the islands and i blessed it because it was the      signal of my release  a worse man than hawthorne would have measured coal quite as well and of all the dismal tasks to which an unremunerated imagination has ever had to accommodate itself i remember none more sordid than the business depicted in the foregoing lines i pray he writes some weeks later that in one year more i may find some way of escaping from this unblest customhouse for it is a very grievous thraldom i do detest all offices all at least that are held on a political tenure and i want nothing to do with politicians their hearts wither away and die out of their bodies their consciences are turned to indiarubber or to some substance as black as that and which will stretch as much one thing if no more i have gained by my customhouse experienceto know a politician it is a knowledge which no previous thought or power of sympathy could have taught me because the animal or the machine rather is not in nature a few days later he goes on in the same strain       i do not think it is the doom laid upon me of murdering so      many of the brightest hours of the day at the customhouse      that makes such havoc with my wits for here i am again      trying to write worthily  yet with a sense as if all the      noblest part of man had been left out of my composition or      had decayed out of it since my nature was given to my own      keeping never comes any bird of paradise into that      dismal region a salt or even a coalship is ten million      times preferable for there the sky is above me and the      fresh breeze around me and my thoughts having hardly      anything to do with my occupation are as free as air      nevertheless  it is only once in a while that the image      and desire of a better and happier life makes me feel the      iron of my chain for after all a human spirit may find no      insufficiency of food for it even in the customhouse and      with such materials as these i do think and feel and learn      things that are worth knowing and which i should not know      unless i had learned them there so that the present      position of my life shall not be quite left out of the sum      of my real existence it is good for me on many      accounts that my life has had this passage in it i know      much more than i did a year ago i have a stronger sense of      power to act as a man among men i have gained worldly      wisdom and wisdom also that is not altogether of this      world and when i quit this earthy career where i am now      buried nothing will cling to me that ought to be left      behind men will not perceive i trust by my look or the      tenor of my thoughts and feelings that i have been a      customhouse officer  he says writing shortly afterwards that when i shall be free again i will enjoy all things with the fresh simplicity of a child of five years old i shall grow young again made all over anew i will go forth and stand in a summer shower and all the worldly dust that has collected on me shall be washed away at once and my heart will be like a bank of fresh flowers for the weary to rest upon  this forecast of his destiny was sufficiently exact a year later in april 1841 he went to take up his abode in the socialistic community of brook farm here he found himself among fields and flowers and other natural productsas well as among many products that could not very justly be called natural he was exposed to summer showers in plenty and his personal associations were as different as possible from those he had encountered in fiscal circles he made acquaintance with transcendentalism and the transcendentalists                                          chapter iv  brook farm and concord   the history of the little industrial and intellectual association which formed itself at this time in one of the suburbs of boston has not to my knowledge been written though it is assuredly a curious and interesting chapter in the domestic annals of new england it would of course be easy to overrate the importance of this ingenious attempt of a few speculative persons to improve the outlook of mankind the experiment came and went very rapidly and quietly leaving very few traces behind it it became simply a charming personal reminiscence for the small number of amiable enthusiasts who had had a hand in it there were degrees of enthusiasm and i suppose there were degrees of amiability but a certain generous brightness of hope and freshness of conviction pervaded the whole undertaking and rendered it morally speaking important to an extent of which any heed that the world in general ever gave to it is an insufficient measure of course it would be a great mistake to represent the episode of brook farm as directly related to the manners and morals of the new england world in generaland in especial to those of the prosperous opulent comfortable part of it the thing was the experiment of a coterieit was unusual unfashionable unsuccessful it was as would then have been said an amusement of the transcendentalistsa harmless effusion of radicalism the transcendentalists were not after all very numerous and the radicals were by no means of the vivid tinge of those of our own day i have said that the brook farm community left no traces behind it that the world in general can appreciate i should rather say that the only trace is a short novel of which the principal merits reside in its qualities of difference from the affair itself the blithedale romance is the main result of brook farm but the blithedale romance was very properly never recognised by the brook farmers as an accurate portrait of their little colony  nevertheless in a society as to which the more frequent complaint is that it is monotonous that it lacks variety of incident and of type the episode our own business with which is simply that it was the cause of hawthornes writing an admirable tale might be welcomed as a picturesque variation at the same time if we do not exaggerate its proportions it may seem to contain a fund of illustration as to that phase of human life with which our authors own history mingled itself the most graceful account of the origin of brook farm is probably to be found in these words of one of the biographers of margaret fuller in boston and its vicinity several friends for whose character margaret felt the highesthonour were earnestly considering the possibility of making such industrial social and educational arrangements as would simplify economies combine leisure for study with healthful and honest toil avert unjust collisions of caste equalise refinements awaken generous affections diffuse courtesy and sweeten and sanctify life as a whole the reader will perceive that this was a liberal scheme and that if the experiment failed the greater was the pity the writer goes on to say that a gentleman who afterwards distinguished himself in literature he had begun by being a clergyman convinced by his experience in a faithful ministry that the need was urgent for a thorough application of the professed principles of fraternity to actual relations was about staking his all of fortune reputation and influence in an attempt to organize a jointstock company at brook farm as margaret fuller passes for having suggested to hawthorne the figure of zenobia in the blithedale romance and as she is probably with one exception the person connected with the affair who after hawthorne offered most of what is called a personality to the world i may venture to quote a few more passages from her memoirsa curious in some points of view almost a grotesque and yet on the whole as i have said an extremely interesting book it was a strange history and a strange destiny that of this brilliant restless and unhappy womanthis ardent new englander this impassioned yankee who occupied so large a place in the thoughts the lives the affections of an intelligent and appreciative society and yet left behind her nothing but the memory of a memory her function her reputation were singular and not altogether reassuring she was a talker she was the talker she was the genius of talk she had a magnificent though by no means an unmitigated egotism and in some of her utterances it is difficult to say whether pride or humility prevailsas for instance when she writes that she feels that there is plenty of room in the universe for my faults and as if i could not spend time in thinking of them when so many things interest me more she has left the same sort of reputation as a great actress some of her writing has extreme beauty almost all of it has a real interest but her value her activity her sway i am not sure that one can say her charm were personal and practical she went to europe expanded to new desires and interests and very poor herself married an impoverished italian nobleman then with her husband and child she embarked to return to her own country and was lost at sea in a terrible storm within sight of its coasts her tragical death combined with many of the elements of her life to convert her memory into a sort of legend so that the people who had known her well grew at last to be envied by later comers hawthorne does not appear to have been intimate with her on the contrary i find such an entry as this in the american notebooks in 1841 i was invited to dine at mr bancrofts yesterday with miss margaret fuller but providence had given me some business to do for which i was very thankful it is true that later the lady is the subject of one or two allusions of a gentler cast one of them indeed is so pretty as to be worth quoting       after leaving the book at mr emersons i returned through      the woods and entering sleepy hollow i perceived a lady      reclining near the path which bends along its verge it was      margaret herself she had been there the whole afternoon      meditating or reading for she had a book in her hand with      some strange title which i did not understand and have      forgotten she said that nobody had broken her solitude and      was just giving utterance to a theory that no inhabitant of      concord ever visited sleepy hollow when we saw a group of      people entering the sacred precincts most of them followed      a path which led them away from us but an old man passed      near us and smiled to see margaret reclining on the ground      and me standing by her side he made some remark upon the      beauty of the afternoon and withdrew himself into the      shadow of the wood then we talked about autumn and about      the pleasures of being lost in the woods and about the      crows whose voices margaret had heard and about the      experiences of early childhood whose influence remains upon      the character after the recollection of them has passed      away and about the sight of mountains from a distance and      the view from their summits and about other matters of high      and low philosophy  it is safe to assume that hawthorne could not on the whole have had a high relish for the very positive personality of this accomplished and argumentative woman in whose intellect high noon seemed ever to reign as twilight did in his own he must have been struck with the glare of her understanding and mentally speaking have scowled and blinked a good deal in conversation with her but it is tolerably manifest nevertheless that she was in his imagination the startingpoint of the figure of zenobia and zenobia is to my sense his only very definite attempt at the representation of a character the portrait is full of alteration and embellishment but it has a greater reality a greater abundance of detail than any of his other figures and the reality was a memory of the lady whom he had encountered in the roxbury pastoral or among the woodwalks of concord with strange books in her hand and eloquent discourse on her lips the blithedale romance was written just after her unhappy death when the reverberation of her talk would lose much of its harshness in fact however very much the same qualities that made hawthorne a democrat in politieshis contemplative turn and absence of a keen perception of abuses his taste for old ideals and loitering paces and muffled toneswould operate to keep him out of active sympathy with a woman of the socalled progressive type we may be sure that in women his taste was conservative  it seems odd as his biographer says that the least gregarious of men should have been drawn into a socialistic community but although it is apparent that hawthorne went to brook farm without any great transcendental fervour yet he had various good reasons for casting his lot in this wouldbe happy family he was as yet unable to marry but he naturally wished to do so as speedily as possible and there was a prospect that brook farm would prove an economical residence and then it is only fair to believe that hawthorne was interested in the experiment and that though he was not a transcendentalist an abolitionist or a fourierite as his companions were in some degree or other likely to be he was willing as a generous and unoccupied young man to lend a hand in any reasonable scheme for helping people to live together on better terms than the common the brook farm scheme was as such things go a reasonable one it was devised and carried out by shrewd and soberminded new englanders who were careful to place economy first and idealism afterwards and who were not afflicted with a gallic passion for completeness of theory there were no formulas doctrines dogmas there was no interference whatever with private life or individual habits and not the faintest adumbration of a rearrangement of that difficult business known as the relations of the sexes the relations of the sexes were neither more nor less than what they usually are in american life excellent and in such particulars the scheme was thoroughly conservative and irreproachable its main characteristic was that each individual concerned in it should do a part of the work necessary for keeping the whole machine going he could choose his work and he could live as he liked it was hoped but it was by no means demanded that he would make himself agreeable like a gentleman invited to a dinnerparty allowing however for everything that was a concession to worldly traditions and to the laxity of mans nature there must have been in the enterprise a good deal of a certain freshness and purity of spirit of a certain noble credulity and faith in the perfectibility of man which it would have been easier to find in boston in the year 1840 than in london fiveandthirty years later if that was the era of transcendentalism transcendentalism could only have sprouted in the soil peculiar to the general locality of which i speakthe soil of the old new england morality gently raked and refreshed by an imported culture the transcendentalists read a great deal of french and german made themselves intimate with george sand and goethe and many other writers but the strong and deep new england conscience accompanied them on all their intellectual excursions and there never was a socalled movement that embodied itself on the whole in fewer eccentricities of conduct or that borrowed a smaller licence in private deportment henry thoreau a delightful writer went to live in the woods but henry thoreau was essentially a sylvan personage and would not have been however the fashion of his time might have turned a man about town the brothers and sisters at brook farm ploughed the fields and milked the cows but i think that an observer from another clime and society would have been much more struck with their spirit of conformity than with their déréglements their ardour was a moral ardour and the lightest breath of scandal never rested upon them or upon any phase of transcendentalism  a biographer of hawthorne might well regret that his hero had not been more mixed up with the reforming and freethinking class so that he might find a pretext for writing a chapter upon the state of boston society forty years ago a needful warrant for such regret should be properly that the biographers own personal reminiscences should stretch back to that period and to the persons who animated it this would be a guarantee of fulness of knowledge and presumably of kindness of tone it is difficult to see indeed how the generation of which hawthorne has given us in blithedale a few portraits should not at this time of day be spoken of very tenderly and sympathetically if irony enter into the allusion it should be of the lightest and gentlest certainly for a brief and imperfect chronicler of these things a writer just touching them as he passes and who has not the advantage of having been a contemporary there is only one possible tone the compiler of these pages though his recollections date only from a later period has a memory of a certain number of persons who had been intimately connected as hawthorne was not with the agitations of that interesting time something of its interest adhered to them stillsomething of its aroma clung to their garments there was something about them which seemed to say that when they were young and enthusiastic they had been initiated into moral mysteries they had played at a wonderful game their usual mark it is true i can think of exceptions was that they seemed excellently good they appeared unstained by the world unfamiliar with worldly desires and standards and with those various forms of human depravity which flourish in some high phases of civilisation inclined to simple and democratic ways destitute of pretensions and affectations of jealousies of cynicism of snobbishness this little epoch of fermentation has three or four drawbacks for the criticdrawbacks however that may be overlooked by a person for whom it has an interest of association it bore intellectually the stamp of provincialism it was a beginning without a fruition a dawn without a noon and it produced with a single exception no great talents it produced a great deal of writing but always putting hawthorne aside as a contemporary but not a sharer only one writer in whom the world at large has interested itself the situation was summed up and transfigured in the admirable and exquisite emerson he expressed all that it contained and a good deal more doubtless besides he was the man of genius of the moment he was the transcendentalist par excellence emerson expressed before all things as was extremely natural at the hour and in the place the value and importance of the individual the duty of making the most of ones self of living by ones own personal light and carrying out ones own disposition he reflected with beautiful irony upon the exquisite impudence of those institutions which claim to have appropriated the truth and to dole it out in proportionate morsels in exchange for a subscription he talked about the beauty and dignity of life and about every one who is born into the world being born to the whole having an interest and a stake in the whole he said all that is clearly due today is not to lie and a great many other things which it would be still easier to present in a ridiculous light he insisted upon sincerity and independence and spontaneity upon acting in harmony with ones nature and not conforming and compromising for the sake of being more comfortable he urged that a man should await his call his finding the thing to do which he should really believe in doing and not be urged by the worlds opinion to do simply the worlds work if no call should come for years for centuries then i know that the want of the universe is the attestation of faith by my abstinence if i cannot work at least i need not lie the doctrine of the supremacy of the individual to himself of his originality and as regards his own character unique quality must have had a great charm for people living in a society in which introspection thanks to the want of other entertainment played almost the part of a social resource  in the united states in those days there were no great things to look out at save forests and rivers life was not in the least spectacular society was not brilliant the country was given up to a great material prosperity a homely bourgeois activity a diffusion of primary education and the common luxuries there was therefore among the cultivated classes much relish for the utterances of a writer who would help one to take a picturesque view of ones internal possibilities and to find in the landscape of the soul all sorts of fine sunrise and moonlight effects meantime while the doors of the temple stand open night and day before every man and the oracles of this truth cease never it is guarded by one stern condition this namelyit is an intuition it cannot be received at second hand truly speaking it is not instruction but provocation that i can receive from another soul to make ones self so much more interesting would help to make life interesting and life was probably to many of this aspiring congregation a dream of freedom and fortitude there were faulty parts in the emersonian philosophy but the general tone was magnificent and i can easily believe that coming when it did and where it did it should have been drunk in by a great many fine moral appetites with a sense of intoxication one envies even i will not say the illusions of that keenly sentient period but the convictions and intereststhe moral passion one certainly envies the privilege of having heard the finest of emersons orations poured forth in their early newness they were the most poetical the most beautiful productions of the american mind and they were thoroughly local and national they had a music and a magic and when one remembers the remarkable charm of the speaker the beautiful modulation of his utterance one regrets in especial that one might not have been present on a certain occasion which made a sensation an erathe delivery of an address to the divinity school of harvard university on a summer evening in 1838 in the light fresh american air unthickened and undarkened by customs and institutions established these things as the phrase is told  hawthorne appears like his own miles coverdale to have arrived at brook farm in the midst of one of those april snowstorms which during the new england spring occasionally diversify the inaction of the vernal process miles coverdale in the blithedale romance is evidently as much hawthorne as he is any one else in particular he is indeed not very markedly any one unless it be the spectator the observer his chief identity lies in his success in looking at things objectively and spinning uncommunicated fancies about them this indeed was the part that hawthorne played socially in the little community at west roxbury his biographer describes him as sitting silently hour after hour in the broad oldfashioned hall of the house where he could listen almost unseen to the chat and merriment of the young people himself almost always holding a book before him but seldom turning the leaves he put his hand to the plough and supported himself and the community as they were all supposed to do by his labour but he contributed little to the hum of voices some of his companions either then or afterwards took i believe rather a gruesome view of his want of articulate enthusiasm and accused him of coming to the place as a sort of intellectual vampire for purely psychological purposes he sat in a corner they declared and watched the inmates when they were off their guard analysing their characters and dissecting the amiable ardour the magnanimous illusions which he was too coldblooded to share in so far as this account of hawthornes attitude was a complaint it was a singularly childish one if he was at brook farm without being of it this is a very fortunate circumstance from the point of view of posterity who would have preserved but a slender memory of the affair if our authors fine novel had not kept the topic open the complaint is indeed almost so ungrateful a one as to make us regret that the authors fellowcommunists came off so easily they certainly would not have done so if the author of blithedale had been more of a satirist certainly if hawthorne was an observer he was a very harmless one and when one thinks of the queer specimens of the reforming genus with which he must have been surrounded one almost wishes that for our entertainment he had given his old companions something to complain of in earnest there is no satire whatever in the romance the quality is almost conspicuous by its absence of portraits there are only two there is no sketching of odd figuresno reproduction of strange types of radicalism the human background is left vague hawthorne was not a satirist and if at brook farm he was according to his habit a good deal of a mild sceptic his scepticism was exercised much more in the interest of fancy than in that of reality  there must have been something pleasantly bucolic and pastoral in the habits of the place during the fine new england summer but we have no retrospective envy of the denizens of brook farm in that other season which as hawthorne somewhere says leaves in those regions so large a blankso melancholy a deathspotin lives so brief that they ought to be all summertime of a summer night when the moon was full says mr lathrop they lit no lamps but sat grouped in the light and shadow while sundry of the younger men sang old ballads or joined tom moores songs to operatic airs on other nights there would be an original essay or poem read aloud or else a play of shakspeare with the parts distributed to different members and these amusements failing some interesting discussion was likely to take their place occasionally in the dramatic season large delegations from the farm would drive into boston in carriages and waggons to the opera or the play sometimes too the young women sang as they washed the dishes in the hive and the youthful yeomen of the society came in and helped them with their work the men wore blouses of a checked or plaided stuff belted at the waist with a broad collar folding down about the throat and rough straw hats the women usually simple calico gowns and hats all this sounds delightfully arcadian and innocent and it is certain that there was something peculiar to the clime and race in some of the features of such a life in the free frank and stainless companionship of young men and maidens in the mixture of manual labour and intellectual flightsdishwashing and æsthetics woodchopping and philosophy wordsworths plain living and high thinking were made actual some passages in margaret fullers journals throw plenty of light on this it must be premised that she was at brook farm as an occasional visitor not as a labourer in the hive       all saturday i was off in the woods in the evening we had      a general conversation opened by me upon education in its      largest sense and on what we can do for ourselves and      others i took my usual groundthe aim is perfection      patience the road our lives should be considered as a      tendency an approximation only mr r spoke admirably      on the nature of loyalty the people showed a good deal of      the sansculotte tendency in their manners throwing      themselves on the floor yawning and going out when they      had heard enough yet as the majority differ with me to      begin withthat being the reason this subject was      chosenthey showed on the whole more interest and      deference than i had expected as i am accustomed to      deference however and need it for the boldness and      animation which my part requires i did not speak with as      much force as usual sundaya glorious day the woods      full of perfume i was out all the morning in the afternoon      mrs r and i had a talk i said my position would be too      uncertain here as i could not work  said they would      all like to work for a person of genius  yes i told      her but where would be my repose when they were always to      be judging whether i was worth it or not each day you      must prove yourself anew  we talked of the principles      of the community i said i had not a right to come because      all the confidence i had in it was as an experiment worth      trying and that it was part of the great wave of inspired      thought we had valuable discussion on these points all      monday morning in the woods again afternoon out with the      drawing party i felt the evils of the want of conventional      refinement in the impudence with which one of the girls      treated me she has since thought of it with regret i      notice and by every days observation of me will see that      she ought not to have done it in the evening a husking in      the barn  a most picturesque scene i stayed and      helped about half an hour and then took a long walk beneath      the stars wednesday in the evening a conversation on      impulse i defended nature as i always dothe spirit      ascending through not superseding nature but in the scale      of sense intellect spirit i advocated the claims of      intellect because those present were rather disposed to      postpone them on the nature of beauty we had good talk       seemed in a much more reverent humour than the other      night and enjoyed the large plans of the universe which      were unrolled saturdaywell goodbye brook farm i      know more about this place than i did when i came but the      only way to be qualified for a judge of such an experiment      would be to become an active though unimpassioned      associate in trying it the girl who was so rude to me      stood waiting with a timid air to bid me goodbye       the young girl in question cannot have been hawthornes      charming priscilla nor yet another young lady of a most      humble spirit who communicated to margarets biographers      her recollections of this remarkable womans visits to brook      farm concluding with the assurance that after a while she      seemed to lose sight of my more prominent and disagreeable      peculiarities and treated me with affectionate regard  hawthornes farewell to the place appears to have been accompanied with some reflections of a cast similar to those indicated by miss fuller in so far at least as we may attribute to hawthorne himself some of the observations that he fathers upon miles coverdale his biographer justly quotes two or three sentences from the blithedale romance as striking the note of the authors feeling about the place no sagacious man says coverdale will long retain his sagacity if he live exclusively among reformers and progressive people without periodically returning to the settled system of things to correct himself by a new observation from that old standpoint and he remarks elsewhere that it struck me as rather odd that one of the first questions raised after our separation from the greedy struggling selfseeking world should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the outside barbarians in their own field of labour but to tell the truth i very soon became sensible that as regarded society at large we stood in a position of new hostility rather than new brotherhood he was doubtless oppressed by the sultry heat of society as he calls it in one of the jottings in the notebooks what would a man do if he were compelled to live always in the sultry heat of society and could never bathe himself in cool solitude his biographer relates that one of the other brook farmers wandering afield one summers day discovered hawthorne stretched at his length upon a grassy hillside with his hat pulled over his face and every appearance in his attitude of the desire to escape detection on his asking him whether he had any particular reason for this shyness of posturetoo much of a party up there hawthorne contented himself with replying with a nod in the direction of the hive he had nevertheless for a time looked forward to remaining indefinitely in the community he meant to marry as soon as possible and bring his wife there to live some sixty pages of the second volume of the american notebooks are occupied with extracts from his letters to his future wife and from his journal which appears however at this time to have been only intermittent consisting almost exclusively of descriptions of the simple scenery of the neighbourhood and of the state of the woods and fields and weather hawthornes fondness for all the common things of nature was deep and constant and there is always something charming in his verbal touch as we may call it when he talks to himself about them oh he breaks out of an october afternoon the beauty of grassy slopes and the hollow ways of paths winding between hills and the intervals between the road and woodlots where summer lingers and sits down strewing dandelions of gold and blue asters as her parting gifts and memorials he was but a single summer at brook farm the rest of his residence had the winterquality  but if he returned to solitude it was henceforth to be as the french say a solitude à deux he was married in july 1842 and betook himself immediately to the ancient village of concord near boston where he occupied the socalled manse which has given the title to one of his collections of tales and upon which this work in turn has conferred a permanent distinction i use the epithets ancient and near in the foregoing sentence according to the american measurement of time and distance concord is some twenty miles from boston and even to day upwards of forty years after the date of hawthornes removal thither it is a very fresh and wellpreserved looking town it had already a local history when a hundred years ago the larger current of human affairs flowed for a moment around it concord has the honour of being the first spot in which blood was shed in the war of the revolution here occurred the first exchange of musketshots between the kings troops and the american insurgents here as emerson says in the little hymn which he contributed in 1836 to the dedication of a small monument commemorating this circumstance      here once the embattled farmers stood       and fired the shot heard round the world  the battle was a small one and the farmers were not destined individually to emerge from obscurity but the memory of these things has kept the reputation of concord green and it has been watered moreover so to speak by the lifelong presence there of one of the most honoured of american men of lettersthe poet from whom i just quoted two lines concord is indeed in itself decidedly verdant and is an excellent specimen of a new england village of the riper sort at the time of hawthornes first going there it must have been an even better specimen than todaymore homogeneous more indigenous more absolutely democratic forty years ago the tide of foreign immigration had scarcely begun to break upon the rural strongholds of the new england race it had at most begun to splash them with the salt hibernian spray it is very possible however that at this period there was not an irishman in concord the place would have been a village community operating in excellent conditions such a village community was not the least honourable item in the sum of new england civilisation its spreading elms and plain white houses its generous summers and ponderous winters its immediate background of promiscuous field and forest would have been part of the composition for the rest there were the selectmen and the townmeetings the townschools and the selfgoverning spirit the rigid morality the friendly and familiar manners the perfect competence of the little society to manage its affairs itself in the delightful introduction to the mosses hawthorne has given an account of his dwelling of his simple occupations and recreations and of some of the characteristics of the place the manse is a large square wooden house to the surface of whicheven in the dry new england air so unfriendly to mosses and lichens and weatherstains and the other elements of a picturesque complexiona hundred and fifty years of exposure have imparted a kind of tone standing just above the slowflowing concord river and approached by a short avenue of overarching trees it had been the dwellingplace of generations of presbyterian ministers ancestors of the celebrated emerson who had himself spent his early manhood and written some of his most beautiful essays there he used as hawthorne says to watch the assyrian dawn and paphian sunset and moonrise from the summit of our eastern hill from its clerical occupants the place had inherited a mild mustiness of theological associationa vague reverberation of old calvinistic sermons which served to deepen its extramundane and somnolent quality the three years that hawthorne passed here were i should suppose among the happiest of his life the future was indeed not in any special manner assured but the present was sufficiently genial in the american notebooks there is a charming passage too long to quote descriptive of the entertainment the new couple found in renovating and refurnishing the old parsonage which at the time of their going into it was given up to ghosts and cobwebs of the little drawingroom which had been most completely reclaimed he writes that the shade of our departed host will never haunt it for its aspect has been as completely changed as the scenery of a theatre probably the ghost gave one peep into it uttered a groan and vanished for ever this departed host was a certain doctor ripley a venerable scholar who left behind him a reputation of learning and sanctity which was reproduced in one of the ladies of his family long the most distinguished woman in the little concord circle doctor ripleys predecessor had been i believe the last of the line of the emerson ministersan old gentleman who in the earlier years of his pastorate stood at the window of his study the same in which hawthorne handled a more irresponsible quill watching with his hands under his long coattails the progress of concord fight it is not by any means related however i should add that he waited for the conclusion to make up his mind which was the righteous cause  hawthorne had a little society as much we may infer as he desired and it was excellent in quality but the pages in the notebooks which relate to his life at the manse and the introduction to the mosses make more of his relations with vegetable nature and of his customary contemplation of the incidents of woodpath and wayside than of the human elements of the scene though these also are gracefully touched upon these pages treat largely of the pleasures of a kitchengarden of the beauty of summersquashes and of the mysteries of appleraising with the wholesome aroma of apples as is indeed almost necessarily the case in any realistic record of new england rural life they are especially pervaded and with many other homely and domestic emanations all of which derive a sweetness from the medium of our authors colloquial style hawthorne was silent with his lips but he talked with his pen the tone of his writing is often that of charming talkingenious fanciful slowflowing with all the lightness of gossip and none of its vulgarity in the preface to the tales written at the manse he talks of many things and just touches upon some of the members of his circleespecially upon that odd genius his fellowvillager henry thoreau i said a little way back that the new england transcendental movement had suffered in the estimation of the world at large from not having putting emerson aside produced any superior talents but any reference to it would be ungenerous which should omit to pay a tribute in passing to the author of walden whatever question there may be of his talent there can be none i think of his genius it was a slim and crooked one but it was eminently personal he was imperfect unfinished inartistic he was worse than provincialhe was parochial it is only at his best that he is readable but at his best he has an extreme natural charm and he must always be mentioned after those americansemerson hawthorne longfellow lowell motleywho have written originally he was emersons independent moral man made fleshliving for the ages and not for saturday and sunday for the universe and not for concord in fact however thoreau lived for concord very effectually and by his remarkable genius for the observation of the phenomena of woods and streams of plants and trees and beasts and fishes and for flinging a kind of spiritual interest over these things he did more than he perhaps intended toward consolidating the fame of his accidental human sojourn he was as shy and ungregarious as hawthorne but he and the latter appear to have been sociably disposed towards each other and there are some charming touches in the preface to the mosses in regard to the hours they spent in boating together on the large quiet concord river thoreau was a great voyager in a canoe which he had constructed himself and which he eventually made over to hawthorne and as expert in the use of the paddle as the red men who had once haunted the same silent stream the most frequent of hawthornes companions on these excursions appears however to have been a local celebrityas well as thoreau a high transcendentalistmr ellery channing whom i may mention since he is mentioned very explicitly in the preface to the mosses and also because no account of the little concord world would be complete which should omit him he was the son of the distinguished unitarian moralist and i believe the intimate friend of thoreau whom he resembled in having produced literary compositions more esteemed by the few than by the many he and hawthorne were both fishermen and the two used to set themselves afloat in the summer afternoons strange and happy times were those exclaims the more distinguished of the two writers when we cast aside all irksome forms and straitlaced habitudes and delivered ourselves up to the free air to live like the indians or any less conventional race during one bright semicircle of the sun rowing our boat against the current between wide meadows we turned aside into the assabeth a more lovely stream than this for a mile above its junction with the concord has never flowed on earthnowhere indeed except to lave the interior regions of a poets imagination it comes flowing softly through the midmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood which whispers it to be quiet while the stream whispers back again from its sedgy borders as if river and wood were hushing one another to sleep yes the river sleeps along its course and dreams of the sky and the clustering foliage while hawthorne was looking at these beautiful things or for that matter was writing them he was well out of the way of a certain class of visitants whom he alludes to in one of the closing passages of this long introduction never was a poor little country village infested with such a variety of queer strangelydressed oddlybehaved mortals most of whom took upon themselves to be important agents of the worlds destiny yet were simply bores of a very intense character these hobgoblins of flesh and blood he says in a preceding paragraph were attracted thither by the widespreading influence of a great original thinker who had his earthly abode at the opposite extremity of our village people that had lighted on a new thought or a thought they fancied new came to emerson as the finder of a glittering gem hastens to a lapidary to ascertain its quality and value and hawthorne enumerates some of the categories of pilgrims to the shrine of the mystic counsellor who as a general thing was probably far from abounding in their own sense when this sense was perverted but gave them a due measure of plain practical advice the whole passage is interesting and it suggests that little concord had not been illtreated by the fateswith a great original thinker at one end of the village an exquisite teller of tales at the other and the rows of new england elms between it contains moreover an admirable sentence about hawthornes pilgrimhaunted neighbour with whom being happy as he says and feeling therefore as if there were no question to be put he was not in metaphysical communion it was good nevertheless to meet him in the woodpaths or sometimes in our avenue with that pure intellectual gleam diffused about his presence like the garment of a shining one and he so quiet so simple so without pretension encountering each man alive as if expecting to receive more than he could impart one may without indiscretion risk the surmise that hawthornes perception of the shining element in his distinguished friend was more intense than his friends appreciation of whatever luminous property might reside within the somewhat dusky envelope of our heros identity as a collector of mosses emerson as a sort of spiritual sunworshipper could have attached but a moderate value to hawthornes catlike faculty of seeing in the dark  as to the daily coarse of our life the latter writes in the spring of 1843 i have written with pretty commendable diligence averaging from two to four hours a day and the result is seen in various magazines i might have written more if it had seemed worth while but i was content to earn only so much gold as might suffice for our immediate wants having prospect of official station and emolument which would do away with the necessity of writing for bread these prospects have not yet had their fulfilment and we are well content to wait for an office would inevitably remove us from our present happy homeat least from an outward home for there is an inner one that will accompany us wherever we go meantime the magazine people do not pay their debts so that we taste some of the inconveniences of poverty it is an annoyance not a trouble and he goes on to give some account of his usual habits the passage is from his journal and the account is given to himself as it were with that odd unfamiliar explicitness which marks the tone of this record throughout every day i trudge through snow and slosh to the village look into the postoffice and spend an hour at the readingroom and then return home generally without having spoken a word to any human being in the way of exercise i saw and split wood and physically i was never in a better condition than now he adds a mention of an absence he had lately made i went alone to salem where i resumed all my bachelor habits for nearly a fortnight leading the same life in which ten years of my youth flitted away like a dream but how much changed was i at last i had got hold of a reality which never could be taken from me it was good thus to get apart from my happiness for the sake of contemplating it  these compositions which were so unpunctually paid for appeared in the democratic review a periodical published at washington and having as our authors biographer says considerable pretensions to a national character it is to be regretted that the practice of keeping its creditors waiting should on the part of the magazine in question have been thought compatible with these pretensions the foregoing lines are a description of a very monotonous but a very contented life and mr lathrop justly remarks upon the dissonance of tone of the tales hawthorne produced under these happy circumstances it is indeed not a little of an anomaly the episode of the manse was one of the most agreeable he had known and yet the best of the mosses though not the greater number of them are singularly dismal compositions they are redolent of m montéguts pessimism the reality of sin the pervasiveness of evil says mr lathrop had been but slightly insisted upon in the earlier tales in this series the idea bursts up like a longburied fire with earthshaking strength and the pits of hell seem yawning beneath us this is very true allowing for mr lathrops rather too emphatic way of putting it but the anomaly is i think on the whole only superficial our writers imagination as has been abundantly conceded was a gloomy one the old puritan sense of sin of penalties to be paid of the darkness and wickedness of life had as i have already suggested passed into it it had not passed into the parts of hawthornes nature corresponding to those occupied by the same horrible vision of things in his ancestors but it had still been determined to claim this later comer as its own and since his heart and his happiness were to escape it insisted on setting its mark upon his geniusupon his most beautiful organ his admirable fancy it may be said that when his fancy was strongest and keenest when it was most itself then the dark puritan tinge showed in it most richly and there cannot be a better proof that he was not the man of a sombre partipris whom m montégut describes than the fact that these duskiest flowers of his invention sprang straight from the soil of his happiest days this surely indicates that there was but little direct connection between the products of his fancy and the state of his affections when he was lightest at heart he was most creative and when he was most creative the moral picturesqueness of the old secret of mankind in general and of the puritans in particular most appealed to himthe secret that we are really not by any means so good as a wellregulated society requires us to appear it is not too much to say even that the very condition of production of some of these unamiable tales would be that they should be superficial and as it were insincere the magnificent little romance of young goodman brown for instance evidently means nothing as regards hawthornes own state of mind his conviction of human depravity and his consequent melancholy for the simple reason that if it meant anything it would mean too much mr lathrop speaks of it as a terrible and lurid parable but this it seems to me is just what it is not it is not a parable but a picture which is a very different thing what does m montégut make one would ask from the point of view of hawthornes pessimism of the singularly objective and unpreoccupied tone of the introduction to the old manse in which the author speaks from himself and in which the cry of metaphysical despair is not even faintly sounded  we have seen that when he went into the village he often came home without having spoken a word to a human being there is a touching entry made a little later bearing upon his mild taciturnity a cloudy veil stretches across the abyss of my nature i have however no love of secrecy and darkness i am glad to think that god sees through my heart and if any angel has power to penetrate into it he is welcome to know everything that is there yes and so may any mortal who is capable of full sympathy and therefore worthy to come into my depths but he must find his own way there i can neither guide nor enlighten him it must be acknowledged however that if he was not able to open the gate of conversation it was sometimes because he was disposed to slide the bolt himself i had a purpose he writes shortly before the entry last quoted if circumstances would permit of passing the whole term of my wifes absence without speaking a word to any human being he beguiled these incommunicative periods by studying german in tieck and bürger without apparently making much progress also in reading french in voltaire and rabelais just now he writes one october noon i heard a sharp tapping at the window of my study and looking up from my book a volume of rabelais behold the head of a little bird who seemed to demand admittance it was a quiet life of course in which these diminutive incidents seemed noteworthy and what is noteworthy here to the observer of hawthornes contemplative simplicity is the fact that though he finds a good deal to say about the little bird he devotes several lines more to it he makes no remark upon rabelais he had other visitors than little birds however and their demands were also not rabelaisian thoreau comes to see him and they talk upon the spiritual advantages of change of place and upon the dial and upon mr alcott and other kindred or concatenated subjects mr alcott was an archtranscendentalist living in concord and the dial was a periodical to which the illuminated spirits of boston and its neighbourhood used to contribute another visitor comes and talks of margaret fuller who he says has risen perceptibly into a higher state since their last meeting there is probably a great deal of concord fiveandthirty years ago in that little sentence                                          chapter v  the three american novels   the prospect of official station and emolument which hawthorne mentions in one of those paragraphs from his journals which i have just quoted as having offered itself and then passed away was at last in the event confirmed by his receiving from the administration of president polk the gift of a place in the customhouse of his native town the office was a modest one and official station may perhaps appear a magniloquent formula for the functions sketched in the admirable introduction to the scarlet letter hawthornes duties were those of surveyor of the port of salem and they had a salary attached which was the important part as his biographer tells us that he had received almost nothing for the contributions to the democratic review he bade farewell to his exparsonage and went back to salem in 1846 and the immediate effect of his ameliorated fortune was to make him stop writing none of his journals of the period from his going to salem to 1850 have been published from which i infer that he even ceased to journalise the scarlet letter was not written till 1849 in the delightful prologue to that work entitled the customhouse he embodies some of the impressions gathered during these years of comparative leisure i say of leisure because he does not intimate in this sketch of his occupations that his duties were onerous he intimates however that they were not interesting and that it was a very good thing for him mentally and morally when his term of service expiredor rather when he was removed from office by the operation of that wonderful rotatory system which his countrymen had invented for the administration of their affairs this sketch of the customhouse is as simple writing one of the most perfect of hawthornes compositions and one of the most gracefully and humorously autobiographic it would be interesting to examine it in detail but i prefer to use my space for making some remarks upon the work which was the ultimate result of this period of hawthornes residence in his native town and i shall for convenience sake say directly afterwards what i have to say about the two companions of the scarlet letterthe house of the seven gables and the blithedale romance i quoted some passages from the prologue to the first of these novels in the early pages of this essay there is another passage however which bears particularly upon this phase of hawthornes career and which is so happily expressed as to make it a pleasure to transcribe itthe passage in which he says that for myself during the whole of my customhouse experience moonlight and sunshine and the glow of the firelight were just alike in my regard and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the twinkle of a tallow candle an entire class of susceptibilities and a gift connected with themof no great richness or value but the best i hadwas gone from me he goes on to say that he believes that he might have done something if he could have made up his mind to convert the very substance of the commonplace that surrounded him into matter of literature       i might for instance have contented myself with writing      out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster one of the      inspectors whom i should be most ungrateful not to mention      since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to      laughter and admiration by his marvellous gift as a      storyteller or i might readily have found a more      serious task it was a folly with the materiality of this      daily life pressing so intrusively upon me to attempt to      fling myself back into another age or to insist on creating      a semblance of a world out of airy matter the wiser      effort would have been to diffuse thought and imagination      through the opaque substance of today and thus make it a      bright transparency  to seek resolutely the true and      indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and      wearisome incidents and ordinary characters with which i was      now conversant the fault was mine the page of life that      was spread out before me was dull and commonplace only      because i had not fathomed its deeper import a better book      than i shall ever write was there these perceptions came      too late i had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor      tales and essays and had become a tolerably good surveyor      of the customs that was all but nevertheless it is      anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion that      ones intellect is dwindling away or exhaling without your      consciousness like ether out of phial so that at every      glance you find a smaller and less volatile residuum  as however it was with what was left of his intellect after three years evaporation that hawthorne wrote the scarlet letter there is little reason to complain of the injury he suffered in his surveyorship  his publisher mr fields in a volume entitled yesterdays with authors has related the circumstances in which hawthornes masterpiece came into the world in the winter of 1849 after he had been ejected from the customhouse i went down to salem to see him and inquire after his health for we heard he had been suffering from illness he was then living in a modest wooden house i found him alone in a chamber over the sittingroom of the dwelling and as the day was cold he was hovering near a stove we fell into talk about his future prospects and he was as i feared i should find him in a very desponding mood his visitor urged him to bethink himself of publishing something and hawthorne replied by calling his attention to the small popularity his published productions had yet acquired and declaring that he had done nothing and had no spirit for doing anything the narrator of the incident urged upon him the necessity of a more hopeful view of his situation and proceeded to take leave he had not reached the street however when hawthorne hurried to overtake him and placing a roll of ms in his hand bade him take it to boston read it and pronounce upon it it is either very good or very bad said the author i dont know which on my way back to boston says mr fields i read the germ of the scarlet letter before i slept that night i wrote him a note all aglow with admiration of the marvellous story he had put into my hands and told him that i would come again to salem the next day and arrange for its publication i went on in such an amazing state of excitement when we met again in the little house that he would not believe i was really in earnest he seemed to think i was beside myself and laughed sadly at my enthusiasm hawthorne however went on with the book and finished it but it appeared only a year later his biographer quotes a passage from a letter which he wrote in february 1850 to his friend horatio bridge i finished my book only yesterday one end being in the press at boston while the other was in my head here at salem so that as you see my story is at least fourteen miles long my book the publisher tells me will not be out before april he speaks of it in tremendous terms of approbation so does mrs hawthorne to whom i read the conclusion last night it broke her heart and sent her to bed with a grievous headachewhich i look upon as a triumphant success judging from the effect upon her and the publisher i may calculate on what bowlers call a tenstrike but i dont make any such calculation and mr lathrop calls attention in regard to this passage to an allusion in the english notebooks september 14 1855 speaking of thackeray i cannot but wonder at his coolness in respect to his own pathos and compare it to my emotions when i read the last scene of the scarlet letter to my wife just after writing ittried to read it rather for my voice swelled and heaved as if i were tossed up and down on an ocean as it subsides after a storm but i was in a very nervous state then having gone through a great diversity of emotion while writing it for many months  the work has the tone of the circumstances in which it was produced if hawthorne was in a sombre mood and if his future was painfully vague the scarlet letter contains little enough of gaiety or of hopefulness it is densely dark with a single spot of vivid colour in it and it will probably long remain the most consistently gloomy of english novels of the first order but i just now called it the authors masterpiece and i imagine it will continue to be for other generations than ours his most substantial title to fame the subject had probably lain a long time in his mind as his subjects were apt to do so that he appears completely to possess it to know it and feel it it is simpler and more complete than his other novels it achieves more perfectly what it attempts and it has about it that charm very hard to express which we find in an artists work the first time he has touched his highest marka sort of straightness and naturalness of execution an unconsciousness of his public and freshness of interest in his theme it was a great success and he immediately found himself famous the writer of these lines who was a child at the time remembers dimly the sensation the book produced and the little shudder with which people alluded to it as if a peculiar horror were mixed with its attractions he was too young to read it himself but its title upon which he fixed his eyes as the book lay upon the table had a mysterious charm he had a vague belief indeed that the letter in question was one of the documents that come by the post and it was a source of perpetual wonderment to him that it should be of such an unaccustomed hue of course it was difficult to explain to a child the significance of poor hester prynnes bloodcoloured a but the mystery was at last partly dispelled by his being taken to see a collection of pictures the annual exhibition of the national academy where he encountered a representation of a pale handsome woman in a quaint black dress and a white coif holding between her knees an elfishlooking little girl fantastically dressed and crowned with flowers embroidered on the womans breast was a great crimson a over which the childs fingers as she glanced strangely out of the picture were maliciously playing i was told that this was hester prynne and little pearl and that when i grew older i might read their interesting history but the picture remained vividly imprinted on my mind i had been vaguely frightened and made uneasy by it and when years afterwards i first read the novel i seemed to myself to have read it before and to be familiar with its two strange heroines i mention this incident simply as an indication of the degree to which the success of the scarlet letter had made the book what is called an actuality hawthorne himself was very modest about it he wrote to his publisher when there was a question of his undertaking another novel that what had given the history of hester prynne its vogue was simply the introductory chapter in fact the publication of the scarlet letter was in the united states a literary event of the first importance the book was the finest piece of imaginative writing yet put forth in the country there was a consciousness of this in the welcome that was given ita satisfaction in the idea of america having produced a novel that belonged to literature and to the forefront of it something might at last be sent to europe as exquisite in quality as anything that had been received and the best of it was that the thing was absolutely american it belonged to the soil to the air it came out of the very heart of new england  it is beautiful admirable extraordinary it has in the highest degree that merit which i have spoken of as the mark of hawthornes best thingsan indefinable purity and lightness of conception a quality which in a work of art affects one in the same way as the absence of grossness does in a human being his fancy as i just now said had evidently brooded over the subject for a long time the situation to be represented had disclosed itself to him in all its phases when i say in all its phases the sentence demands modification for it is to be remembered that if hawthorne laid his hand upon the wellworn theme upon the familiar combination of the wife the lover and the husband it was after all but to one period of the history of these three persons that he attached himself the situation is the situation after the womans fault has been committed and the current of expiation and repentance has set in in spite of the relation between hester prynne and arthur dimmesdale no story of love was surely ever less of a love story to hawthornes imagination the fact that these two persons had loved each other too well was of an interest comparatively vulgar what appealed to him was the idea of their moral situation in the long years that were to follow the story indeed is in a secondary degree that of hester prynne she becomes really after the first scene an accessory figure it is not upon her the dénoûment depends it is upon her guilty lover that the author projects most frequently the cold thin rays of his fitfullymoving lantern which makes here and there a little luminous circle on the edge of which hovers the livid and sinister figure of the injured and retributive husband the story goes on for the most part between the lover and the husbandthe tormented young puritan minister who carries the secret of his own lapse from pastoral purity locked up beneath an exterior that commends itself to the reverence of his flock while he sees the softer partner of his guilt standing in the full glare of exposure and humbling herself to the misery of atonementbetween this more wretched and pitiable culprit to whom dishonour would come as a comfort and the pillory as a relief and the older keener wiser man who to obtain satisfaction for the wrong he has suffered devises the infernally ingenious plan of conjoining himself with his wronger living with him living upon him and while he pretends to minister to his hidden ailment and to sympathise with his pain revels in his unsuspected knowledge of these things and stimulates them by malignant arts the attitude of roger chillingworth and the means he takes to compensate himselfthese are the highly original elements in the situation that hawthorne so ingeniously treats none of his works are so impregnated with that aftersense of the old puritan consciousness of life to which allusion has so often been made if as m montégut says the qualities of his ancestors filtered down through generations into his composition the scarlet letter was as it were the vessel that gathered up the last of the precious drops and i say this not because the story happens to be of socalled historical cast to be told of the early days of massachusetts and of people in steeplecrowned hats and sad coloured garments the historical colouring is rather weak than otherwise there is little elaboration of detail of the modern realism of research and the author has made no great point of causing his figures to speak the english of their period nevertheless the book is full of the moral presence of the race that invented hesters penancediluted and complicated with other things but still perfectly recognisable puritanism in a word is there not only objectively as hawthorne tried to place it there but subjectively as well not i mean in his judgment of his characters in any harshness of prejudice or in the obtrusion of a moral lesson but in the very quality of his own vision in the tone of the picture in a certain coldness and exclusiveness of treatment  the faults of the book are to my sense a want of reality and an abuse of the fanciful elementof a certain superficial symbolism the people strike me not as characters but as representatives very picturesquely arranged of a single state of mind and the interest of the story lies not in them but in the situation which is insistently kept before us with little progression though with a great deal as i have said of a certain stable variation and to which they out of their reality contribute little that helps it to live and move i was made to feel this want of reality this overingenuity of the scarlet letter by chancing not long since upon a novel which was read fifty years ago much more than today but which is still worth readingthe story of adam blair by john gibson lockhart this interesting and powerful little tale has a great deal of analogy with hawthornes novelquite enough at least to suggest a comparison between them and the comparison is a very interesting one to make for it speedily leads us to larger considerations than simple resemblances and divergences of plot  adam blair like arthur dimmesdale is a calvinistic minister who becomes the lover of a married woman is overwhelmed with remorse at his misdeed and makes a public confession of it then expiates it by resigning his pastoral office and becoming a humble tiller of the soil as his father had been the two stories are of about the same length and each is the masterpiece putting aside of course as far as lockhart is concerned the life of scott of the author they deal alike with the manners of a rigidly theological society and even in certain details they correspond in each of them between the guilty pair there is a charming little girl though i hasten to say that sarah blair who is not the daughter of the heroine but the legitimate offspring of the hero a widower is far from being as brilliant and graceful an apparition as the admirable little pearl of the scarlet letter the main difference between the two tales is the fact that in the american story the husband plays an allimportant part and in the scottish plays almost none at all adam blair is the history of the passion and the scarlet letter the history of its sequel but nevertheless if one has read the two books at a short interval it is impossible to avoid confronting them i confess that a large portion of the interest of adam blair to my mind when once i had perceived that it would repeat in a great measure the situation of the scarlet letter lay in noting its difference of tone it threw into relief the passionless quality of hawthornes novel its element of cold and ingenious fantasy its elaborate imaginative delicacy these things do not precisely constitute a weakness in the starlet letter indeed in a certain way they constitute a great strength but the absence of a certain something warm and straightforward a trifle more grossly human and vulgarly natural which one finds in adam blair will always make hawthornes tale less touching to a large number of even very intelligent readers than a lovestory told with the robust synthetic pathos which served lockhart so well his novel is not of the first rank i should call it an excellent secondrate one but it borrows a charm from the fact that his vigorous but not strongly imaginative mind was impregnated with the reality of his subject he did not always succeed in rendering this reality the expression is sometimes awkward and poor but the reader feels that his vision was clear and his feeling about the matter very strong and rich hawthornes imagination on the other hand plays with his theme so incessantly leads it such a dance through the moonlighted air of his intellect that the thing cools off as it were hardens and stiffens and producing effects much more exquisite leaves the reader with a sense of having handled a splendid piece of silversmiths work lockhart by means much more vulgar produces at moments a greater illusion and satisfies our inevitable desire for something in the people in whom it is sought to interest us that shall be of the same pitch and the same continuity with ourselves above all it is interesting to see how the same subject appears to two men of a thoroughly different cast of mind and of a different race lockhart was struck with the warmth of the subject that offered itself to him and hawthorne with its coldness the one with its glow its sentimental interestthe other with its shadow its moral interest lockharts story is as decent as severely draped as the scarlet letter but the author has a more vivid sense than appears to have imposed itself upon hawthorne of some of the incidents of the situation he describes his tempted man and tempting woman are more actual and personal his heroine in especial though not in the least a delicate or a subtle conception has a sort of credible visible palpable property a vulgar roundness and relief which are lacking to the dim and chastened image of hester prynne but i am going too far i am comparing simplicity with subtlety the usual with the refined each man wrote as his turn of mind impelled him but each expressed something more than himself lockhart was a dense substantial briton with a taste for the concrete and hawthorne was a thin new englander with a miasmatic conscience  in the scarlet letter there is a great deal of symbolism there is i think too much it is overdone at times and becomes mechanical it ceases to be impressive and grazes triviality the idea of the mystic a which the young minister finds imprinted upon his breast and eating into his flesh in sympathy with the embroidered badge that hester is condemned to wear appears to me to be a case in point this suggestion should i think have been just made and dropped to insist upon it and return to it is to exaggerate the weak side of the subject hawthorne returns to it constantly plays with it and seems charmed by it until at last the reader feels tempted to declare that his enjoyment of it is puerile in the admirable scene so superbly conceived and beautifully executed in which mr dimmesdale in the stillness of the night in the middle of the sleeping town feels impelled to go and stand upon the scaffold where his mistress had formerly enacted her dreadful penance and then seeing hester pass along the street from watching at a sickbed with little pearl at her side calls them both to come and stand there beside himin this masterly episode the effect is almost spoiled by the introduction of one of these superficial conceits what leads up to it is very fineso fine that i cannot do better than quote it as a specimen of one of the striking pages of the book       but before mr dimmesdale had done speaking a light      gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky it was      doubtless caused by one of those meteors which the      nightwatcher may so often observe burning out to waste in      the vacant regions of the atmosphere so powerful was its      radiance that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of      cloud betwixt the sky and earth the great vault      brightened like the dome of an immense lamp it showed the      familiar scene of the street with the distinctness of      midday but also with the awfulness that is always imparted      to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light the wooden      houses with their jutting stories and quaint gablepeaks      the doorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing      up about them the gardenplots black with freshlyturned      earth the wheeltrack little worn and even in the      marketplace margined with green on either sideall were      visible but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to      give another moral interpretation to the things of this      world than they had ever borne before and there stood the      minister with his hand over his heart and hester prynne      with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom and      little pearl herself a symbol and the connectinglink      between these two they stood in the noon of that strange      and solemn splendour as if it were the light that is to      reveal all secrets and the daybreak that shall unite all      that belong to one another  that is imaginative impressive poetic but when almost immediately afterwards the author goes on to say that the minister looking upward to the zenith beheld there the appearance of an immense letterthe letter amarked out in lines of dull red light we feel that he goes too far and is in danger of crossing the line that separates the sublime from its intimate neighbour we are tempted to say that this is not moral tragedy but physical comedy in the same way too much is made of the intimation that hesters badge had a scorching property and that if one touched it one would immediately withdraw ones hand hawthorne is perpetually looking for images which shall place themselves in picturesque correspondence with the spiritual facts with which he is concerned and of course the search is of the very essence of poetry but in such a process discretion is everything and when the image becomes importunate it is in danger of seeming to stand for nothing more serious than itself when hester meets the minister by appointment in the forest and sits talking with him while little pearl wanders away and plays by the edge of the brook the child is represented as at last making her way over to the other side of the woodland stream and disporting herself there in a manner which makes her mother feel herself in some indistinct and tantalising manner estranged from pearl as if the child in her lonely ramble through the forest had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together and was now vainly seeking to return to it and hawthorne devotes a chapter to this idea of the childs having by putting the brook between hester and herself established a kind of spiritual gulf on the verge of which her little fantastic person innocently mocks at her mothers sense of bereavement this conception belongs one would say quite to the lighter order of a storytellers devices and the reader hardly goes with hawthorne in the large development he gives to it he hardly goes with him either i think in his extreme predilection for a small number of vague ideas which are represented by such terms as sphere and sympathies hawthorne makes too liberal a use of these two substantives it is the solitary defect of his style and it counts as a defect partly because the words in question are a sort of specialty with certain writers immeasurably inferior to himself  i had not meant however to expatiate upon his defects which are of the slenderest and most venial kind the scarlet letter has the beauty and harmony of all original and complete conceptions and its weaker spots whatever they are are not of its essence they are mere light flaws and inequalities of surface one can often return to it it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art it is admirably written hawthorne afterwards polished his style to a still higher degree but in his later productionsit is almost always the case in a writers later productionsthere is a touch of mannerism in the scarlet letter there is a high degree of polish and at the same time a charming freshness his phrase is less conscious of itself his biographer very justly calls attention to the fact that his style was excellent from the beginning that he appeared to have passed through no phase of learning how to write but was in possession of his means from the first of his handling a pen his early tales perhaps were not of a character to subject his faculty of expression to a very severe test but a man who had not hawthornes natural sense of language would certainly have contrived to write them less well this natural sense of languagethis turn for saying things lightly and yet touchingly picturesquely yet simply and for infusing a gently colloquial tone into matter of the most unfamiliar import he had evidently cultivated with great assiduity i have spoken of the anomalous character of his notebooksof his going to such pains often to make a record of incidents which either were not worth remembering or could be easily remembered without its aid but it helps us to understand the notebooks if we regard them as a literary exercise they were compositions as school boys say in which the subject was only the pretext and the main point was to write a certain amount of excellent english hawthorne must at least have written a great many of these things for practice and he must often have said to himself that it was better practice to write about trifles because it was a greater tax upon ones skill to make them interesting and his theory was just for he has almost always made his trifles interesting in his novels his art of saying things well is very positively tested for here he treats of those matters among which it is very easy for a blundering writer to go wrongthe subtleties and mysteries of life the moral and spiritual maze in such a passage as one i have marked for quotation from the scarlet letter there is the stamp of the genius of style       hester prynne gazing steadfastly at the clergyman felt a      dreary influence come over her but wherefore or whence she      knew not unless that he seemed so remote from her own      sphere and utterly beyond her reach one glance of      recognition she had imagined must needs pass between them      she thought of the dim forest with its little dell of      solitude and love and anguish and the mossy treetrunk      where sitting hand in hand they had mingled their sad and      passionate talk with the melancholy murmur of the brook how      deeply had they known each other then and was this the man      she hardly knew him now he moving proudly past enveloped      as it were in the rich music with the procession of      majestic and venerable fathers he so unattainable in his      worldly position and still more so in that far vista in      his unsympathising thoughts through which she now beheld      him her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a      delusion and that vividly as she had dreamed it there      could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself and      thus much of woman there was in hester that she could      scarcely forgive himleast of all now when the heavy      footstep of their approaching fate might be heard nearer      nearer nearerfor being able to withdraw himself so      completely from their mutual world while she groped darkly      and stretched forth her cold hands and found him not  the house of the seven gables was written at lenox among the mountains of massachusetts a village nestling rather loosely in one of the loveliest corners of new england to which hawthorne had betaken himself after the success of the scarlet letter became conspicuous in the summer of 1850 and where he occupied for two years an uncomfortable little red house which is now pointed out to the inquiring stranger the inquiring stranger is now a frequent figure at lenox for the place has suffered the process of lionisation it has become a prosperous wateringplace or at least as there are no waters as they say in america a summerresort it is a brilliant and generous landscape and thirty years ago a man of fancy desiring to apply himself might have found both inspiration and tranquillity there hawthorne found so much of both that he wrote more during his two years of residence at lenox than at any period of his career he began with the house of the seven gables which was finished in the early part of 1851 this is the longest of his three american novels it is the most elaborate and in the judgment of some persons it is the finest it is a rich delightful imaginative work larger and more various than its companions and full of all sorts of deep intentions of interwoven threads of suggestion but it is not so rounded and complete as the scarlet letter it has always seemed to me more like a prologue to a great novel than a great novel itself i think this is partly owing to the fact that the subject the donnée as the french say of the story does not quite fill it out and that we get at the same time an impression of certain complicated purposes on the authors part which seem to reach beyond it i call it larger and more various than its companions and it has indeed a greater richness of tone and density of detail the colour so to speak of the house of the seven gables is admirable but the story has a sort of expansive quality which never wholly fructifies and as i lately laid it down after reading it for the third time i had a sense of having interested myself in a magnificent fragment yet the book has a great fascination and of all of those of its authors productions which i have read over while writing this sketch it is perhaps the one that has gained most by reperusal if it be true of the others that the pure natural quality of the imaginative strain is their great merit this is at least as true of the house of the seven gables the charm of which is in a peculiar degree of the kind that we fail to reduce to its groundslike that of the sweetness of a piece of music or the softness of fine september weather it is vague indefinable ineffable but it is the sort of thing we must always point to in justification of the high claim that we make for hawthorne in this case of course its vagueness is a drawback for it is difficult to point to ethereal beauties and if the reader whom we have wished to inoculate with our admiration inform us after looking a while that he perceives nothing in particular we can only reply that in effect the object is a delicate one  the house of the seven gables comes nearer being a picture of contemporary american life than either of its companions but on this ground it would be a mistake to make a large claim for it it cannot be too often repeated that hawthorne was not a realist he had a high sense of realityhis notebooks superabundantly testify to it and fond as he was of jotting down the items that make it up he never attempted to render exactly or closely the actual facts of the society that surrounded him i have saidi began by sayingthat his pages were full of its spirit and of a certain reflected light that springs from it but i was careful to add that the reader must look for his local and national quality between the lines of his writing and in the indirect testimony of his tone his accent his temper of his very omissions and suppressions the house of the seven gables has however more literal actuality than the others and if it were not too fanciful an account of it i should say that it renders to an initiated reader the impression of a summer afternoon in an elmshadowed new england town it leaves upon the mind a vague correspondence to some such reminiscence and in stirring up the association it renders it delightful the comparison is to the honour of the new england town which gains in it more than it bestows the shadows of the elms in the house of the seven gables are exceptionally dense and cool the summer afternoon is peculiarly still and beautiful the atmosphere has a delicious warmth and the long daylight seems to pause and rest but the mild provincial quality is there the mixture of shabbiness and freshness the paucity of ingredients the end of an old racethis is the situation that hawthorne has depicted and he has been admirably inspired in the choice of the figures in whom he seeks to interest us they are all figures rather than charactersthey are all pictures rather than persons but if their reality is light and vague it is sufficient and it is in harmony with the low relief and dimness of outline of the objects that surround them they are all types to the authors mind of something general of something that is bound up with the history at large of families and individuals and each of them is the centre of a cluster of those ingenious and meditative musings rather melancholy as a general thing than joyous which melt into the current and texture of the story and give it a kind of moral richness a grotesque old spinster simple childish penniless very humble at heart but rigidly conscious of her pedigree an amiable bachelor of an epicurean temperament and an enfeebled intellect who has passed twenty years of his life in penal confinement for a crime of which he was unjustly pronounced guilty a sweetnatured and brightfaced young girl from the country a poor relation of these two ancient decrepitudes with whose moral mustiness her modern freshness and soundness are contrasted a young man still more modern holding the latest opinions who has sought his fortune up and down the world and though he has not found it takes a genial and enthusiastic view of the future these with two or three remarkable accessory figures are the persons concerned in the little drama the drama is a small one but as hawthorne does not put it before us for its own superficial sake for the dry facts of the case but for something in it which he holds to be symbolic and of large application something that points a moral and that it behoves us to remember the scenes in the rusty wooden house whose gables give its name to the story have something of the dignity both of history and of tragedy miss hephzibah pyncheon dragging out a disappointed life in her paternal dwelling finds herself obliged in her old age to open a little shop for the sale of penny toys and gingerbread this is the central incident of the tale and as hawthorne relates it it is an incident of the most impressive magnitude and most touching interest her dishonoured and vagueminded brother is released from prison at the same moment and returns to the ancestral roof to deepen her perplexities but on the other hand to alleviate them and to introduce a breath of the air of the outer world into this long unventilated interior the little country cousin also arrives and proves the good angel of the feebly distracted household all this episode is exquisiteadmirably conceived and executed with a kind of humorous tenderness an equal sense of everything in it that is picturesque touching ridiculous worthy of the highest praise hephzibah pyncheon with her nearsighted scowl her rusty joints her antique turban her map of a great territory to the eastward which ought to have belonged to her family her vain terrors and scruples and resentments the inaptitude and repugnance of an ancient gentlewoman to the vulgar little commerce which a cruel fate has compelled her to engage inhephzibah pyncheon is a masterly picture i repeat that she is a picture as her companions are pictures she is a charming piece of descriptive writing rather than a dramatic exhibition but she is described like her companions too so subtly and lovingly that we enter into her virginal old heart and stand with her behind her abominable little counter clifford pyncheon is a still more remarkable conception though he is perhaps not so vividly depicted it was a figure needing a much more subtle touch however and it was of the essence of his character to be vague and unemphasised nothing can be more charming than the manner in which the soft bright active presence of phoebe pyncheon is indicated or than the account of her relations with the poor dimly sentient kinsman for whom her lighthanded sisterly offices in the evening of a melancholy life are a revelation of lost possibilities of happiness in her aspect hawthorne says of the young girl there was a familiar gladness and a holiness that you could play with and yet reverence it as much as ever she was like a prayer offered up in the homeliest beauty of ones mothertongue fresh was phoebe moreover and airy and sweet in her apparel as if nothing that she woreneither her gown nor her small straw bonnet nor her little kerchief any more than her snowy stockingshad ever been put on before or if worn were all the fresher for it and with a fragrance as if they had lain among the rosebuds of the influence of her maidenly salubrity upon poor clifford hawthorne gives the prettiest description and then breaking off suddenly renounces the attempt in language which while pleading its inadequacy conveys an exquisite satisfaction to the reader i quote the passage for the sake of its extreme felicity and of the charming image with which it concludes       but we strive in vain to put the idea into words no      adequate expression of the beauty and profound pathos with      which it impresses us is attainable this being made only      for happiness and heretofore so miserably failing to be      happyhis tendencies so hideously thwarted that some      unknown time ago the delicate springs of his character      never morally or intellectually strong had given way and      he was now imbecilethis poor forlorn voyager from the      islands of the blest in a frail bark on a tempestuous sea      had been flung by the last mountainwave of his shipwreck      into a quiet harbour there as he lay more than half      lifeless on the strand the fragrance of an earthly rosebud      had come to his nostrils and as odours will had summoned      up reminiscences or visions of all the living and breathing      beauty amid which he should have had his home with his      native susceptibility of happy influences he inhales the      slight ethereal rapture into his soul and expires  i have not mentioned the personage in the house of the seven gables upon whom hawthorne evidently bestowed most pains and whose portrait is the most elaborate in the book partly because he is in spite of the space he occupies an accessory figure and partly because even more than the others he is what i have called a picture rather than a character judge pyncheon is an ironical portrait very richly and broadly executed very sagaciously composed and renderedthe portrait of a superb full blown hypocrite a largebased fullnurtured pharisee bland urbane impressive diffusing about him a sultry warmth of benevolence as the author calls it again and again and basking in the noontide of prosperity and the consideration of society but in reality hard gross and ignoble judge pyncheon is an elaborate piece of description made up of a hundred admirable touches in which satire is always winged with fancy and fancy is linked with a deep sense of reality it is difficult to say whether hawthorne followed a model in describing judge pyncheon but it is tolerably obvious that the picture is an impressiona copious impressionof an individual it has evidently a definite startingpoint in fact and the author is able to draw freely and confidently after the image established in his mind holgrave the modern young man who has been a jackofalltrades and is at the period of the story a daguerreotypist is an attempt to render a kind of national typethat of the young citizen of the united states whose fortune is simply in his lively intelligence and who stands naked as it were unbiased and unencumbered alike in the centre of the farstretching level of american life holgrave is intended as a contrast his lack of traditions his democratic stamp his condensed experience are opposed to the desiccated prejudices and exhausted vitality of the race of which poor feeblyscowling rustyjointed hephzibah is the most heroic representative it is perhaps a pity that hawthorne should not have proposed to himself to give the old pyncheonqualities some embodiment which would help them to balance more fairly with the elastic properties of the young daguerreotypistshould not have painted a lusty conservative to match his strenuous radical as it is the mustiness and mouldiness of the tenants of the house of the seven gables crumble away rather too easily evidently however what hawthorne designed to represent was not the struggle between an old society and a new for in this case he would have given the old one a better chance but simply as i have said the shrinkage and extinction of a family this appealed to his imagination and the idea of long perpetuation and survival always appears to have filled him with a kind of horror and disapproval conservative in a certain degree as he was himself and fond of retrospect and quietude and the mellowing influences of time it is singular how often one encounters in his writings some expression of mistrust of old houses old institutions long lines of descent he was disposed apparently to allow a very moderate measure in these respects and he condemns the dwelling of the pyncheons to disappear from the face of the earth because it has been standing a couple of hundred years in this he was an american of americans or rather he was more american than many of his countrymen who though they are accustomed to work for the short run rather than the long have often a lurking esteem for things that show the marks of having lasted i will add that holgrave is one of the few figures among those which hawthorne created with regard to which the absence of the realistic mode of treatment is felt as a loss holgrave is not sharply enough characterised he lacks features he is not an individual but a type but my last word about this admirable novel must not be a restrictive one it is a large and generous production pervaded with that vague hum that indefinable echo of the whole multitudinous life of man which is the real sign of a great work of fiction  after the publication of the house of the seven gables which brought him great honour and i believe a tolerable share of a more ponderable substance he composed a couple of little volumes for childrenthe wonderbook and a small collection of stories entitled tanglewood tales they are not among his most serious literary titles but if i may trust my own early impression of them they are among the most charming literary services that have been rendered to children in an age and especially in a country in which the exactions of the infant mind have exerted much too palpable an influence upon literature hawthornes stories are the old greek myths made more vivid to the childish imagination by an infusion of details which both deepen and explain their marvels i have been careful not to read them over for i should be very sorry to risk disturbing in any degree a recollection of them that has been at rest since the appreciative period of life to which they are addressed they seem at that period enchanting and the ideal of happiness of many american children is to lie upon the carpet and lose themselves in the wonderbook it is in its pages that they first make the acquaintance of the heroes and heroines of the antique mythology and something of the nursery fairytale quality of interest which hawthorne imparts to them always remains  i have said that lenox was a very pretty place and that he was able to work there hawthorne proved by composing the house of the seven gables with a good deal of rapidity but at the close of the year in which this novel was published he wrote to a friend mr fields his publisher that to tell you a secret i am sick to death of berkshire and hate to think of spending another winter here the air and climate do not agree with my health at all and for the first time since i was a boy i have felt languid and dispirited o that providence would build me the merest little shanty and mark me out a rood or two of garden ground near the seacoast he was at this time for a while out of health and it is proper to remember that though the massachusetts berkshire with its mountains and lakes was charming during the ardent american summer there was a reverse to the medal consisting of december snows prolonged into april and may providence failed to provide him with a cottage by the sea but he betook himself for the winter of 1852 to the little town of west newton near boston where he brought into the world the blithedale romance  this work as i have said would not have been written if hawthorne had not spent a year at brook farm and though it is in no sense of the word an account of the manners or the inmates of that establishment it will preserve the memory of the ingenious community at west roxbury for a generation unconscious of other reminders i hardly know what to say about it save that it is very charming this vague unanalytic epithet is the first that comes to ones pen in treating of hawthornes novels for their extreme amenity of form invariably suggests it but if on the one hand it claims to be uttered on the other it frankly confesses its inconclusiveness perhaps however in this case it fills out the measure of appreciation more completely than in others for the blithedale romance is the lightest the brightest the liveliest of this company of unhumorous fictions  the story is told from a more joyous point of viewfrom a point of view comparatively humorousand a number of objects and incidents touched with the light of the profane worldthe vulgar manycoloured world of actuality as distinguished from the crepuscular realm of the writers own reveriesare mingled with its course the book indeed is a mixture of elements and it leaves in the memory an impression analogous to that of an april dayan alternation of brightness and shadow of broken sunpatches and sprinkling clouds its dénoûment is tragicalthere is indeed nothing so tragical in all hawthorne unless it be the murderof miriams persecutor by donatello in transformation as the suicide of zenobia and yet on the whole the effect of the novel is to make one think more agreeably of life the standpoint of the narrator has the advantage of being a concrete one he is no longer as in the preceding tales a disembodied spirit imprisoned in the haunted chamber of his own contemplations but a particular man with a certain human grossness  of miles coverdale i have already spoken and of its being natural to assume that in so far as we may measure this lightly indicated identity of his it has a great deal in common with that of his creator coverdale is a picture of the contemplative observant analytic nature nursing its fancies and yet thanks to an element of strong good sense not bringing them up to be spoiled children having little at stake in life at any given moment and yet indulging in imagination in a good many adventures a portrait of a man in a word whose passions are slender whose imagination is active and whose happiness lies not in doing but in perceivinghalf a poet half a critic and all a spectator he is contrasted excellently with the figure of hollingsworth the heavily treading reformer whose attitude with regard to the world is that of the hammer to the anvil and who has no patience with his friends indifferences and neutralities coverdale is a gentle sceptic a mild cynic he would agree that life is a little worth livingor worth living a little but would remark that unfortunately to live little enough we have to live a great deal he confesses to a want of earnestness but in reality he is evidently an excellent fellow to whom one might look not for any personal performance on a great scale but for a good deal of generosity of detail as hollingsworth once told me i lack a purpose he writes at the close of his story how strange he was ruined morally by an over plus of the same ingredient the want of which i occasionally suspect has rendered my own life all an emptiness i by no means wish to die yet were there any cause in this whole chaos of human struggle worth a sane mans dying for and which my death would benefit thenprovided however the effort did not involve an unreasonable amount of troublemethinks i might be bold to offer up my life if kossuth for example would pitch the battlefield of hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode and choose a mild sunny morning after breakfast for the conflict miles coverdale would gladly be his man for one brave rush upon the levelled bayonets further than that i should be loth to pledge myself  the finest thing in the blithdale romance is the character of zenobia which i have said elsewhere strikes me as the nearest approach that hawthorne has made to the complete creation of a person she is more concrete than hester or miriam or hilda or phoebe she is a more definite image produced by a greater multiplicity of touches it is idle to inquire too closely whether hawthorne had margaret fuller in his mind in constructing the figure of this brilliant specimen of the strongminded class and endowing her with the genius of conversation or on the assumption that such was the case to compare the image at all strictly with the model there is no strictness in the representation by novelists of persons who have struck them in life and there can in the nature of things be none from the moment the imagination takes a hand in the game the inevitable tendency is to divergence to following what may be called new scents the original gives hints but the writer does what he likes with them and imports new elements into the picture if there is this amount of reason for referring the wayward heroine of blithedale to hawthornes impression of the most distinguished woman of her day in boston that margaret fuller was the only literary lady of eminence whom there is any sign of his having known that she was proud passionate and eloquent that she was much connected with the little world of transcendentalism out of which the experiment of brook farm sprung and that she had a miserable end and a watery graveif these are facts to be noted on one side i say on the other the beautiful and sumptuous zenobia with her rich and picturesque temperament and physical aspects offers many points of divergence from the plain and strenuous invalid who represented feminine culture in the suburbs of the new england metropolis this picturesqueness of zenobia is very happily indicated and maintained she is a woman in all the force of the term and there is something very vivid and powerful in her large expression of womanly gifts and weaknesses hollingsworth is i think less successful though there is much reality in the conception of the type to which he belongsthe strongwilled narrowhearted apostle of a special form of redemption for society there is nothing better in all hawthorne than the scene between him and coverdale when the two men are at work together in the field piling stones on a dyke and he gives it to his companion to choose whether he will be with him or against him it is a pity perhaps to have represented him as having begun life as a blacksmith for one grudges him the advantage of so logical a reason for his roughness and hardness       hollingsworth scarcely said a word unless when repeatedly      and pertinaciously addressed then indeed he would glare      upon us from the thick shrubbery of his meditations like a      tiger out of a jungle make the briefest reply possible and      betake himself back into the solitude of his heart and      mind his heart i imagine was never really interested      in our socialist scheme but was for ever busy with his      strange and as most people thought impracticable plan for      the reformation of criminals through an appeal to their      higher instincts much as i liked hollingsworth it cost me      many a groan to tolerate him on this point he ought to have      commenced his investigation of the subject by committing      some huge sin in his proper person and examining the      condition of hishigher instincts afterwards  the most touching element in the novel is the history of the grasp that this barbarous fanatic has laid upon the fastidious and hightempered zenobia who disliking him and shrinking from him at a hundred points is drawn into the gulf of his omnivorous egotism the portion of the story that strikes me as least felicitous is that which deals with priscilla and with her mysterious relation to zenobiawith her mesmeric gifts her clairvoyance her identity with the veiled lady her divided subjection to hollingsworth and westervelt and her numerous other graceful but fantastic propertiesher sibylline attributes as the author calls them hawthorne is rather too fond of sibylline attributesa taste of the same order as his disposition to which i have already alluded to talk about spheres and sympathies as the action advances in the blithdale romance we get too much out of reality and cease to feel beneath our feet the firm ground of an appeal to our own vision of the world our observation i should have liked to see the story concern itself more with the little community in which its earlier scenes are laid and avail itself of so excellent an opportunity for describing unhackneyed specimens of human nature i have already spoken of the absence of satire in the novel of its not aiming in the least at satire and of its offering no grounds for complaint as an invidious picture indeed the brethren of brook farm should have held themselves slighted rather than misrepresented and have regretted that the admirable genius who for a while was numbered among them should have treated their institution mainly as a perch for starting upon an imaginative flight but when all is said about a certain want of substance and cohesion in the latter portions of the blithedale romance the book is still a delightful and beautiful one zenobia and hollingsworth live in the memory and even priscilla and coverdale who linger there less importunately have a great deal that touches us and that we believe in i said just now that priscilla was infelicitous but immediately afterwards i open the volume at a page in which the author describes some of the outofdoor amusements at blithedale and speaks of a footrace across the grass in which some of the slim young girls of the society joined priscillas peculiar charm in a footrace was the weakness and irregularity with which she ran growing up without exercise except to her poor little fingers she had never yet acquired the perfect use of her legs setting buoyantly forth therefore as if no rival less swift than atalanta could compete with her she ran falteringly and often tumbled on the grass such an incidentthough it seems too slight to think ofwas a thing to laugh at but which brought the water into ones eyes and lingered in the memory after far greater joys and sorrows were wept out of it as antiquated trash priscillas life as i beheld it was full of trifles that affected me in just this way that seems to me exquisite and the book is full of touches as deep and delicate  after writing it hawthorne went back to live in concord where he had bought a small house in which apparently he expected to spend a large portion of his future this was in fact the dwelling in which he passed that part of the rest of his days that he spent in his own country he established himself there before going to europe in 1853 and he returned to the wayside as he called his house on coming back to the united states seven years later though he actually occupied the place no long time he had made it his property and it was more his own home than any of his numerous provisional abodes i may therefore quote a little account of the house which he wrote to a distinguished friend mr george curtis       as for my old house you will understand it better after      spending a day or two in it before mr alcott took it in      hand it was a meanlooking affair with two peaked gables      no suggestiveness about it and no venerableness although      from the style of its construction it seems to have survived      beyond its first century he added a porch in front and a      central peak and a piazza at each end and painted it a      rusty olive hue and invested the whole with a modest      picturesqueness all which improvements together with its      situation at the foot of a wooded hill make it a place that      one notices and remembers for a few moments after passing      mr alcott expended a good deal of taste and some money to      no great purpose in forming the hillside behind the house      into terraces and building arbours and summerhouses of      rough stems and branches and trees on a system of his own      they must have been very pretty in their day and are so      still although much decayed and shattered more and more by      every breeze that blows the hillside is covered chiefly      with locust trees which come into luxuriant blossom in the      month of june and look and smell very sweetly intermixed      with a few young elms and white pines and infant oaksthe      whole forming rather a thicket than a wood nevertheless      there is some very good shade to be found there i spend      delectable hours there in the hottest part of the day      stretched out at my lazy length with a book in my hand or      some unwritten book in my thoughts there is almost always a      breeze stirring along the sides or brow of the hill from      the hilltop there is a good view along the extensive level      surfaces and gentle hilly outlines covered with wood that      characterise the scenery of concord i know nothing of      the history of the house except thoreaus telling me that it      was inhabited a generation or two ago by a man who      believed he should never die i believe however he is      dead at least i hope so else he may probably reappear and      dispute my title to his residence  as mr lathrop points out this allusion to a man who believed he should never die is the first intimation of the story of septimius felton the scenery of that romance he adds was evidently taken from the wayside and its hill septimius felton is in fact a young man who at the time of the war of the revolution lives in the village of concord on the boston road at the base of a woody hill which rises abruptly behind his house and of which the level summit supplies him with a promenade continually mentioned in the course of the tale hawthorne used to exercise himself upon this picturesque eminence and as he conceived the brooding septimius to have done before him to betake himself thither when he found the limits of his dwelling too narrow but he had an advantage which his imaginary hero lacked he erected a tower as an adjunct to the house and it was a jocular tradition among his neighbours in allusion to his attributive tendency to evade rather than hasten the coming guest that he used to ascend this structure and scan the road for provocations to retreat  in so far however as hawthorne suffered the penalties of celebrity at the hands of intrusive fellowcitizens he was soon to escape from this honourable incommodity on the 4th of march 1853 his old collegemate and intimate friend franklin pierce was installed as president of the united states he had been the candidate of the democratic party and all good democrats accordingly in conformity to the beautiful and rational system under which the affairs of the great republic were carried on begun to open their windows to the golden sunshine of presidential patronage when general pierce was put forward by the democrats hawthorne felt a perfectly loyal and natural desire that his good friend should be exalted to so brilliant a position and he did what was in him to further the good cause by writing a little book about its hero his life of franklin pierce belongs to that class of literature which is known as the campaign biography and which consists of an attempt more or less successful to persuade the manyheaded monster of universal suffrage that the gentleman on whose behalf it is addressed is a paragon of wisdom and virtue of hawthornes little book there is nothing particular to say save that it is in very good taste that he is a very fairly ingenious advocate and that if he claimed for the future president qualities which rather faded in the bright light of a high office this defect of proportion was essential to his undertaking he dwelt chiefly upon general pierces exploits in the war with mexico before that his record as they say in america had been mainly that of a successful country lawyer and exercised his descriptive powers so far as was possible in describing the advance of the united states troops from vera cruz to the city of the montezumas the mouthpieces of the whig party spared him i believe no reprobation for prostituting his exquisite genius but i fail to see anything reprehensible in hawthornes lending his old friend the assistance of his graceful quill he wished him to be presidenthe held afterwards that he filled the office with admirable dignity and wisdomand as the only thing he could do was to write he fell to work and wrote for him hawthorne was a good lover and a very sufficient partisan and i suspect that if franklin pierce had been made even less of the stuff of a statesman he would still have found in the force of old associations an injunction to hail him as a ruler our hero was an american of the earlier and simpler typethe type of which it is doubtless premature to say that it has wholly passed away but of which it may at least be said that the circumstances that produced it have been greatly modified the generation to which he belonged that generation which grew up with the century witnessed during a period of fifty years the immense uninterrupted material development of the young republic and when one thinks of the scale on which it took place of the prosperity that walked in its train and waited on its course of the hopes it fostered and the blessings it conferred of the broad morning sunshine in a word in which it all went forward there seems to be little room for surprise that it should have implanted a kind of superstitious faith in the grandeur of the country its duration its immunity from the usual troubles of earthly empires this faith was a simple and uncritical one enlivened with an element of genial optimism in the light of which it appeared that the great american state was not as other human institutions are that a special providence watched over it that it would go on joyously for ever and that a country whose vast and blooming bosom offered a refuge to the strugglers and seekers of all the rest of the world must come off easily in the battle of the ages from this conception of the american future the sense of its having problems to solve was blissfully absent there were no difficulties in the programme no looming complications no rocks ahead the indefinite multiplication of the population and its enjoyment of the benefits of a commonschool education and of unusual facilities for making an incomethis was the form in which on the whole the future most vividly presented itself and in which the greatness of the country was to be recognised of men there was indeed a faint shadow in the picturethe shadow projected by the peculiar institution of the southern states but it was far from sufficient to darken the rosy vision of most good americans and above all of most good democrats hawthorne alludes to it in a passage of his life of pierce which i will quote not only as a hint of the trouble that was in store for a cheerful race of men but as an example of his own easygoing political attitude       it was while in the lower house of congress that franklin      pierce took that stand on the slavery question from which he      has never since swerved by a hairs breadth he fully      recognised by his votes and his voice the rights pledged to      the south by the constitution this at the period when he      declared himself was an easy thing to do but when it      became more difficult when the first imperceptible murmur      of agitation had grown almost to a convulsion his course      was still the same nor did he ever shun the obloquy that      sometimes threatened to pursue the northern man who dared to      love that great and sacred realityhis whole united      countrybetter than the mistiness of a philanthropic      theory  this last invidious allusion is to the disposition not infrequent at the north but by no means general to set a decisive limit to further legislation in favour of the cherished idiosyncrasy of the other half of the country hawthorne takes the license of a sympathetic biographer in speaking of his heros having incurred obloquy by his conservative attitude on the question of slavery the only class in the american world that suffered in the smallest degree at this time from social persecution was the little band of northern abolitionists who were as unfashionable as they were indiscreetwhich is saying much like most of his fellowcountrymen hawthorne had no idea that the respectable institution which he contemplated in impressive contrast to humanitarian mistiness was presently to cost the nation four long years of bloodshed and misery and a social revolution as complete as any the world has seen when this event occurred he was therefore proportionately horrified and depressed by it it cut from beneath his feet the familiar ground which had long felt so firm substituting a heaving and quaking medium in which his spirit found no rest such was the bewildered sensation of that earlier and simpler generation of which i have spoken their illusions were rudely dispelled and they saw the best of all possible republics given over to fratricidal carnage this affair had no place in their scheme and nothing was left for them but to hang their heads and close their eyes the subsidence of that great convulsion has left a different tone from the tone it found and one may say that the civil war marks an era in the history of the american mind it introduced into the national consciousness a certain sense of proportion and relation of the world being a more complicated place than it had hitherto seemed the future more treacherous success more difficult at the rate at which things are going it is obvious that good americana will be more numerous than ever but the good american in days to come will be a more critical person than his complacent and confident grandfather he has eaten of the tree of knowledge he will not i think be a sceptic and still less of course a cynic but he will be without discredit to his wellknown capacity for action an observer he will remember that the ways of the lord are inscrutable and that this is a world in which everything happens and eventualities as the late emperor of the french used to say will not find him intellectually unprepared the good american of which hawthorne was so admirable a specimen was not critical and it was perhaps for this reason that franklin pierce seemed to him a very proper president  the least that general pierce could do in exchange for so liberal a confidence was to offer his old friend one of the numerous places in his gift hawthorne had a great desire to go abroad and see something of the world so that a consulate seemed the proper thing he never stirred in the matter himself but his friends strongly urged that something should be done and when he accepted the post of consul at liverpool there was not a word of reasonable criticism to be offered on the matter if general pierce who was before all things goodnatured and obliging had been guilty of no greater indiscretion than to confer this modest distinction upon the most honourable and discreet of men of letters he would have made a more brilliant mark in the annals of american statesmanship liverpool had not been immediately selected and hawthorne had written to his friend and publisher mr fields with some humorous vagueness of allusion to his probable expatriation       do make some inquiries about portugal as for instance in      what part of the world it lies and whether it is an empire      a kingdom or a republic also and more particularly the      expenses of living there and whether the minister would be      likely to be much pestered with his own countrymen also      any other information about foreign countries would be      acceptable to an inquiring mind  it would seem from this that there had been a question of offering him a small diplomatic post but the emoluments of the place were justly taken into account and it is to be supposed that those of the consulate at liverpool were at least as great as the salary of the american representative at lisbon unfortunately just after hawthorne had taken possession of the former post the salary attached to it was reduced by congress in an economical hour to less than half the sum enjoyed by his predecessors it was fixed at 7500 dollars £1500 but the consular fees which were often copious were an added resource at midsummer then in 1853 hawthorne was established in england                                          chapter vi  england and italy   hawthorne was close upon fifty years of age when he came to europea fact that should be remembered when those impressions which he recorded in five substantial volumes exclusive of the novel written in italy occasionally affect us by the rigidity of their point of view his notebooks kept during his residence in england his two winters in rome his summer in florence were published after his death his impressions of england sifted revised and addressed directly to the public he gave to the world shortly before this event the tone of his european diaries is often so fresh and unsophisticated that we find ourselves thinking of the writer as a young man and it is only a certain final sense of something reflective and a trifle melancholy that reminds us that the simplicity which is on the whole the leading characteristic of their pages is though the simplicity of inexperience not that of youth when i say inexperience i mean that hawthornes experience had been narrow his fifty years had been spent for much the larger part in small american townssalem the boston of forty years ago concord lenox west newtonand he had led exclusively what one may call a villagelife this is evident not at all directly and superficially but by implication and between the lines in his desultory history of his foreign years in other words and to call things by their names he was exquisitely and consistently provincial i suggest this fact not in the least in condemnation but on the contrary in support of an appreciative view of him i know nothing more remarkable more touching than the sight of this odd youthfulelderly mind contending so late in the day with new opportunities for learning old things and on the whole profiting by them so freely and gracefully the notebooks are provincial and so in a greatly modified degree are the sketches of england in our old home but the beauty and delicacy of this latter work are so interwoven with the authors air of being remotely outside of everything he describes that they count for more seem more themselves and finally give the whole thing the appearance of a triumph not of initiation but of the provincial point of view itself  i shall not attempt to relate in detail the incidents of his residence in england he appears to have enjoyed it greatly in spite of the deficiency of charm in the place to which his duties chiefly confined him his confinement however was not unbroken and his published journals consist largely of minute accounts of little journeys and wanderings with his wife and his three children through the rest of the country together with much mention of numerous visits to london a city for whose dusky immensity and multitudinous interest he professed the highest relish his notebooks are of the same cast as the two volumes of his american diaries of which i have given some accountchiefly occupied with external matters with the accidents of daily life with observations made during the long walks often with his son which formed his most valued pastime his office moreover though liverpool was not a delectable home furnished him with entertainment as well as occupation and it may almost be said that during these years he saw more of his fellowcountrymen in the shape of odd wanderers petitioners and inquirers of every kind than he had ever done in his native land the paper entitled consular experiences in our old home is an admirable recital of these observations and a proof that the novelist might have found much material in the opportunities of the consul on his return to america in 1860 he drew from his journal a number of pages relating to his observations in england rewrote them with i should suppose a good deal of care and converted them into articles which he published in a magazine these chapters were afterwards collected and our old home a rather infelicitous title was issued in 1863 i prefer to speak of the book now however rather than in touching upon the closing years of his life for it is a kind of deliberate résumé of his impressions of the land of his ancestors it is not a good or a weighty book he wrote to his publisher who had sent him some reviews of it nor does it deserve any great amount of praise or censure i dont care about seeing any more notices of it hawthornes appreciation of his own productions was always extremely just he had a sense of the relations of things which some of his admirers have not thought it well to cultivate and he never exaggerated his own importance as a writer our old home is not a weighty book it is decidedly a light one but when he says it is not a good one i hardly know what he means and his modesty at this point is in excess of his discretion whether good or not our old home is charmingit is most delectable reading the execution is singularly perfect and ripe of all his productions it seems to be the best written the touch as musicians say is admirable the lightness the fineness the felicity of characterisation and description belong to a man who has the advantage of feeling delicately his judgment is by no means always sound it often rests on too narrow an observation but his perception is of the keenest and though it is frequently partial incomplete it is excellent as far as it goes the book gave but limited satisfaction i believe in england and i am not sure that the failure to enjoy certain manifestations of its sportive irony has not chilled the appreciation of its singular grace that english readers on the whole should have felt that hawthorne did the national mind and manners but partial justice is i think conceivable at the same time that it seems to me remarkable that the tender side of the book as i may call it should not have carried it off better it abounds in passages more delicately appreciative than can easily be found elsewhere and it contains more charming and affectionate things than i should suppose had ever before been written about a country not the writers own to say that it is an immeasurably more exquisite and sympathetic work than any of the numerous persons who have related their misadventures in the united states have seen fit to devote to that country is to say but little and i imagine that hawthorne had in mind the array of english voyagersmrs trollope dickens marryat basil hall miss martineau mr grattanwhen he reflected that everything is relative and that as such books go his own little volume observed the amenities of criticism he certainly had it in mind when he wrote the phrase in his preface relating to the impression the book might make in england not an englishman of them all ever spared america for courtesys sake or kindness nor in my opinion would it contribute in the least to any mutual advantage and comfort if we were to besmear each other all over with butter and honey i am far from intending to intimate that the vulgar instinct of recrimination had anything to do with the restrictive passages of our old home i mean simply that the author had a prevision that his collection of sketches would in some particulars fail to please his english friends he professed after the event to have discovered that the english are sensitive and as they say of the americans for whose advantage i believe the term was invented thinskinned the english critics he wrote to his publisher seem to think me very bitter against their countrymen and it is perhaps natural that they should because their selfconceit can accept nothing short of indiscriminate adulation but i really think that americans have much more cause than they to complain of me looking over the volume i am rather surprised to find that whenever i draw a comparison between the two people i almost invariably cast the balance against ourselves and he writes at another timei received several private letters and printed notices of our old home from england it is laughable to see the innocent wonder with which they regard my criticisms accounting for them by jaundice insanity jealousy hatred on my part and never admitting the least suspicion that there may be a particle of truth in them the monstrosity of their selfconceit is such that anything short of unlimited admiration impresses them as malicious caricature but they do me great injustice in supposing that i hate them i would as soon hate my own people the idea of his hating the english was of course too puerile for discussion and the book as i have said is full of a rich appreciation of the finest characteristics of the country but it has a serious defecta defect which impairs its value though it helps to give consistency to such an image of hawthornes personal nature as we may by this time have been able to form it is the work of an outsider of a stranger of a man who remains to the end a mere spectator something less even than an observer and always lacks the final initiation into the manners and nature of a people of whom it may most be said among all the people of the earth that to know them is to make discoveries hawthorne freely confesses to this constant exteriority and appears to have been perfectly conscious of it i remember he writes in the sketch of a london suburb in our old home i remember to this day the dreary feeling with which i sat by our first english fireside and watched the chill and rainy twilight of an autumn day darkening down upon the garden while the preceding occupant of the house evidently a most unamiable personage in his lifetime scowled inhospitably from above the mantelpiece as if indignant that an american should try to make himself at home there possibly it may appease his sulky shade to know that i quitted his abode as much a stranger as i entered it the same note is struck in an entry in his journal of the date of october 6th 1854       the people for several days have been in the utmost      anxiety and latterly in the highest exultation about      sebastopoland all england and europe to boot have been      fooled by the belief that it had fallen this however now      turns out to be incorrect and the public visage is somewhat      grim in consequence i am glad of it in spite of his actual      sympathies it is impossible for an american to be otherwise      than glad success makes an englishman intolerable and      already on the mistaken idea that the way was open to a      prosperous conclusion of the war the times had begun to      throw out menaces against america i shall never love      england till she sues to us for help and in the meantime      the fewer triumphs she obtains the better for all parties      an englishman in adversity is a very respectable character      he does not lose his dignity but merely comes to a proper      conception of himself i seem to myself like a spy or      traitor when i meet their eyes and am conscious that i      neither hope nor fear in sympathy with them although they      look at me in full confidence of sympathy their heart      knoweth its own bitterness and as for me being a      stranger and an alien i intermeddle not with their joy  this seems to me to express very well the weak side of hawthornes workhis constant mistrust and suspicion of the society that surrounded him his exaggerated painful morbid national consciousness it is i think an indisputable fact that americans are as americans the most selfconscious people in the world and the most addicted to the belief that the other nations of the earth are in a conspiracy to undervalue them they are conscious of being the youngest of the great nations of not being of the european family of being placed on the circumference of the circle of civilisation rather than at the centre of the experimental element not having as yet entirely dropped out of their great political undertaking the sense of this relativity in a word replaces that quiet and comfortable sense of the absolute as regards its own position in the world which reigns supreme in the british and in the gallic genius few persons i think can have mingled much with americans in europe without having made this reflection and it is in england that their habit of looking askance at foreign institutionsof keeping one eye as it were on the american personality while with the other they contemplate these objectsis most to be observed add to this that hawthorne came to england late in life when his habits his tastes his opinions were already formed that he was inclined to look at things in silence and brood over them gently rather than talk about them discuss them grow acquainted with them by action and it will be possible to form an idea of our writers detached and critical attitude in the country in which it is easiest thanks to its aristocratic constitution to the absence of any considerable public fund of entertainment and diversion to the degree in which the inexhaustible beauty and interest of the place are private property demanding constantly a special introductionin the country in which i say it is easiest for a stranger to remain a stranger for a stranger to cease to be a stranger he must stand ready as the french say to pay with his person and this was an obligation that hawthorne was indisposed to incur our sense as we read that his reflections are those of a shy and susceptible man with nothing at stake mentally in his appreciation of the country is therefore a drawback to our confidence but it is not a drawback sufficient to make it of no importance that he is at the same time singularly intelligent and discriminating with a faculty of feeling delicately and justly which constitutes in itself an illumination there is a passage in the sketch entitled about warwick which is a very good instance of what was probably his usual state of mind he is speaking of the aspect of the high street of the town       the street is an emblem of england itself what seems new      in it is chiefly a skilful and fortunate adaptation of what      such a people as ourselves would destroy the new things are      based and supported on sturdy old things and derive a      massive strength from their deep and immemorial foundations      though with such limitations and impediments as only an      englishman could endure but he likes to feel the weight of      all the past upon his back and moreover the antiquity that      overburdens him has taken root in his being and has grown      to be rather a hump than a pack so that there is no getting      rid of it without tearing his whole structure to pieces in      my judgment as he appears to be sufficiently comfortable      under the mouldy accretion he had better stumble on with it      as long as he can he presents a spectacle which is by no      means without its charm for a disinterested and unincumbered      observer  there is all hawthorne with his enjoyment of the picturesque his relish of chiaroscuro of local colour of the deposit of time and his still greater enjoyment of his own dissociation from these things his disinterested and unincumbered condition his want of incumbrances may seem at times to give him a somewhat naked and attenuated appearance but on the whole he carries it off very well i have said that our old home contains much of his best writing and on turning over the book at hazard i am struck with his frequent felicity of phrase at every step there is something one would like to quotesomething excellently well said these things are often of the lighter sort but hawthornes charming diction lingers in the memoryalmost in the ear i have always remembered a certain admirable characterisation of doctor johnson in the account of the writers visit to lichfieldand i will preface it by a paragraph almost as good commemorating the charms of the hotel in that interesting town       at any rate i had the great dull dingy and dreary      coffeeroom with its heavy old mahogany chairs and tables      all to myself and not a soul to exchange a word with except      the waiter who like most of his class in england had      evidently left his conversational abilities uncultivated no      former practice of solitary living nor habits of reticence      nor welltested selfdependence for occupation of mind and      amusement can quite avail as i now proved to dissipate      the ponderous gloom of an english coffeeroom under such      circumstances as these with no book at hand save the county      directory nor any newspaper but a torn local journal of      five days ago so i buried myself betimes in a huge heap      of ancient feathers there is no other kind of bed in these      old inns let my head sink into an unsubstantial pillow      and slept a stifled sleep compounded of the nighttroubles      of all my predecessors in that same unrestful couch and      when i awoke the odour of a bygone century was in my      nostrilsa faint elusive smell of which i never had any      conception before crossing the atlantic  the whole chapter entitled lichfield and uttoxeter is a sort of graceful tribute to samuel johnson who certainly has nowhere else been more tenderly spoken of       beyond all question i might have had a wiser friend than      he the atmosphere in which alone he breathed was dense his      awful dread of death showed how much muddy imperfection was      to be cleansed out of him before he could be capable of      spiritual existence he meddled only with the surface of      life and never cared to penetrate further than to      ploughshare depth his very sense and sagacity were but a      oneeyed clearsightedness i laughed at him sometimes      standing beside his knee and yet considering that my      native propensities were toward fairy land and also how      much yeast is generally mixed up with the mental sustenance      of a new englander it may not have been altogether amiss      in those childish and boyish days to keep pace with this      heavyfooted traveller and feed on the gross diet that he      carried in his knapsack it is wholesome food even now and      then how english many of the latent sympathies that      enabled me to enjoy the old country so well and that so      readily amalgamated themselves with the american ideas that      seemed most adverse to them may have been derived from or      fostered and kept alive by the great english moralist      never was a descriptive epithet more nicely appropriate than      that doctor johnsons morality was as english an article as      a beefsteak  and for mere beauty of expression i cannot forbear quoting this passage about the days in a fine english summer       for each day seemed endless though never wearisome as far      as your actual experience is concerned the english summer      day has positively no beginning and no end when you awake      at any reasonable hour the sun is already shining through      the curtains you live through unnumbered hours of sabbath      quietude with a calm variety of incident softly etched upon      their tranquil lapse and at length you become conscious      that it is bedtime again while there is still enough      daylight in the sky to make the pages of your book      distinctly legible night if there be any such season      hangs down a transparent veil through which the bygone day      beholds its successor or if not quite true of the latitude      of london it may be soberly affirmed of the more northern      parts of the island that tomorrow is born before its      yesterday is dead they exist together in the golden      twilight where the decrepit old day dimly discerns the face      of the ominous infant and you though a mere mortal may      simultaneously touch them both with one finger of      recollection and another of prophecy  the notebooks as i have said deal chiefly with the superficial aspect of english life and describe the material objects with which the author was surrounded they often describe them admirably and the rural beauty of the country has never been more happily expressed but there are inevitably a great many reflections and incidental judgments characterisations of people he met fragments of psychology and social criticism and it is here that hawthornes mixture of subtlety and simplicity his interfusion of genius with what i have ventured to call the provincial quality is most apparent to an american reader this later quality which is never grossly manifested but pervades the journals like a vague natural perfume an odour of purity and kindness and integrity must always for a reason that i will touch upon have a considerable charm and such a reader will accordingly take an even greater satisfaction in the diaries kept during the two years hawthorne spent in italy for in these volumes the element i speak of is especially striking he resigned his consulate at liverpool towards the close of 1857whether because he was weary of his manner of life there and of the place itself as may well have been or because he wished to anticipate supersession by the new government mr buchanans which was just establishing itself at washington is not apparent from the slender sources of information from which these pages have been compiled in the month of january of the following year he betook himself with his family to the continent and as promptly as possible made the best of his way to rome he spent the remainder of the winter and the spring there and then went to florence for the summer and autumn after which he returned to rome and passed a second season his italian notebooks are very pleasant reading but they are of less interest than the others for his contact with the life of the country its people and its manners was simply that of the ordinary touristwhich amounts to saying that it was extremely superficial he appears to have suffered a great deal of discomfort and depression in rome and not to have been on the whole in the best mood for enjoying the place and its resources that he did at one time and another enjoy these things keenly is proved by his beautiful romance transformation which could never have been written by a man who had not had many hours of exquisite appreciation of the lovely land of italy but he took it hard as it were and suffered himself to be painfully discomposed by the usual accidents of italian life as foreigners learn to know it his future was again uncertain and during his second winter in rome he was in danger of losing his elder daughter by a malady which he speaks of as a trouble that pierced to my very vitals i may mention with regard to this painful episode that franklin pierce whose presidential days were over and who like other expresidents was travelling in europe came to rome at the time and that the notebooks contain some singularly beautiful and touching allusions to his old friends gratitude for his sympathy and enjoyment of his society the sentiment of friendship has on the whole been so much less commemorated in literature than might have been expected from the place it is supposed to hold in life that there is always something striking in any frank and ardent expression of it it occupied in so far as pierce was the object of it a large place in hawthornes mind and it is impossible not to feel the manly tenderness of such lines as these       i have found him here in rome the whole of my early      friend and even better than i used to know him a heart as      true and affectionate a mind much widened and deepened by      the experience of life we hold just the same relation to      one another as of yore and we have passed all the      turningoff places and may hope to go on together still      the same dear friends as long as we live i do not love him      one whit the less for having been president nor for having      done me the greatest good in his power a fact that speaks      eloquently in his favour and perhaps says a little for      myself if he had been merely a benefactor perhaps i might      not have borne it so well but each did his best for the      other as friend for friend  the notebooks are chiefly taken up with descriptions of the regular sights and objects of interest which we often feel to be rather perfunctory and a little in the style of the traditional tourists diary they abound in charming touches and every reader of transformation will remember the delightful colouring of the numerous pages in that novel which are devoted to the pictorial aspects of rome but we are unable to rid ourselves of the impression that hawthorne was a good deal bored by the importunity of italian art for which his taste naturally not keen had never been cultivated occasionally indeed he breaks out into explicit sighs and groans and frankly declares that he washes his hands of it already in england he had made the discovery that he could easily feel overdosed with such things yesterday he wrote in 1856 i went out at about twelve and visited the british museum an exceedingly tiresome affair it quite crushes a person to see so much at once and i wandered from hall to hall with a weary and heavy heart wishing heaven forgive me that the elgin marbles and the frieze of the parthenon were all burnt into lime and that the granite egyptian statues were hewn and squared into building stones  the plastic sense was not strong in hawthorne there can be no better proof of it than his curious aversion to the representation of the nude in sculpture this aversion was deepseated he constantly returns to it exclaiming upon the incongruity of modern artists making naked figures he apparently quite failed to see that nudity is not an incident or accident of sculpture but its very essence and principle and his jealousy of undressed images strikes the reader as a strange vague longdormant heritage of his straightlaced puritan ancestry whenever he talks of statues he makes a great point of the smoothness and whiteness of the marblespeaks of the surface of the marble as if it were half the beauty of the image and when he discourses of pictures one feels that the brightness or dinginess of the frame is an essential part of his impression of the workas he indeed somewhere distinctly affirms like a good american he took more pleasure in the productions of mr thompson and mr brown mr powers and mr hart american artists who were plying their trade in italy than in the works which adorned the ancient museums of the country he suffered greatly from the cold and found little charm in the climate and during the weeks of winter that followed his arrival in rome he sat shivering by his fire and wondering why he had come to such a land of misery before he left italy he wrote to his publisheri bitterly detest rome and shall rejoice to bid it farewell for ever and i fully acquiesce in all the mischief and ruin that has happened to it from neros conflagration downward in fact i wish the very site had been obliterated before i ever saw it hawthorne presents himself to the reader of these pages as the last of the oldfashioned americansand this is the interest which i just now said that his compatriots would find in his very limitations i do not mean by this that there are not still many of his fellowcountrymen as there are many natives of every land under the sun who are more susceptible of being irritated than of being soothed by the influences of the eternal city what i mean is that an american of equal value with hawthorne an american of equal genius imagination and as our forefathers said sensibility would at present inevitably accommodate himself more easily to the idiosyncrasies of foreign lands an american as cultivated as hawthorne is now almost inevitably more cultivated and as a matter of course more europeanised in advance more cosmopolitan it is very possible that in becoming so he has lost something of his occidental savour the quality which excites the goodwill of the american reader of our authors journals for the dislocated depressed even slightly bewildered diarist absolutely the last of the earlier race of americans hawthorne was fortunately probably far from being but i think of him as the last specimen of the more primitive type of men of letters and when it comes to measuring what he succeeded in being in his unadulterated form against what he failed of being the positive side of the image quite extinguishes the negative i must be on my guard however against incurring the charge of cherishing a national consciousness as acute as i have ventured to pronounce his own  out of his mingled sensations his pleasure and his weariness his discomforts and his reveries there sprang another beautiful work during the summer of 1858 he hired a picturesque old villa on the hill of bellosguardo near florence a curious structure with a crenelated tower which after having in the course of its career suffered many vicissitudes and played many parts now finds its most vivid identity in being pointed out to strangers as the sometime residence of the celebrated american romancer hawthorne took a fancy to the place as well he might for it is one of the loveliest spots on earth and the great view that stretched itself before him contains every element of beauty florence lay at his feet with her memories and treasures the olivecovered hills bloomed around him studded with villas as picturesque as his own the apennines perfect in form and colour disposed themselves opposite and in the distance along its fertile valley the arno wandered to pisa and the sea soon after coming hither he wrote to a friend in a strain of high satisfaction       it is pleasant to feel at last that i am really away from      americaa satisfaction that i never really enjoyed as long      as i stayed in liverpool where it seemed to be that the      quintessence of nasal and handshaking yankeedom was      gradually filtered and sublimated through my consulate on      the way outward and homeward i first got acquainted with my      own countrymen there at rome too it was not much better      but here in florence and in the summertime and in this      secluded villa i have escaped out of all my old tracks      and am really remote i like my present residence      immensely the house stands on a hill overlooking florence      and is big enough to quarter a regiment insomuch that each      member of the family including servants has a separate      suite of apartments and there are vast wildernesses of      upper rooms into which we have never yet sent exploring      expeditions at one end of the house there is a mossgrown      tower haunted by owls and by the ghost of a monk who was      confined there in the thirteenth century previous to being      burnt at the stake in the principal square of florence i      hire this villa tower and all at twentyeight dollars a      month but i mean to take it away bodily and clap it into a      romance which i have in my head ready to be written out  this romance was transformation which he wrote out during the following winter in rome and rewrote during the several months that he spent in england chiefly at leamington before returning to america the villa montauto figures in fact in this tale as the castle of montebeni the patrimonial dwelling of the hero i take some credit to myself he wrote to the same friend on returning to rome for having sternly shut myself up for an hour or two every day and come to close grips with a romance which i have been trying to tear out of my mind and later in the same winter he saysi shall go home i fear with a heavy heart not expecting to be very well contented there if i were but a hundred times richer than i am how very comfortable i could be i consider it a great piece of good fortune that i have had experience of the discomforts and miseries of italy and did not go directly home from england anything will seem like a paradise after a roman winter but he got away at last late in the spring carrying his novel with him and the book was published after as i say he had worked it over mainly during some weeks that he passed at the little wateringplace of redcar on the yorkshire coast in february of the following year it was issued primarily in england the american edition immediately followed it is an odd fact that in the two countries the book came out under different titles the title that the author had bestowed upon it did not satisfy the english publishers who requested him to provide it with another so that it is only in america that the work bears the name of the marble fawn hawthornes choice of this appellation is by the way rather singular for it completely fails to characterise the story the subject of which is the living faun the faun of flesh and blood the unfortunate donatello his marble counterpart is mentioned only in the opening chapter on the other hand hawthorne complained that transformation gives one the idea of harlequin in a pantomime under either name however the book was a great success and it has probably become the most popular of hawthornes four novels it is part of the intellectual equipment of the anglosaxon visitor to rome and is read by every englishspeaking traveller who arrives there who has been there or who expects to go  it has a great deal of beauty of interest and grace but it has to my sense a slighter value than its companions and i am far from regarding it as the masterpiece of the author a position to which we sometimes hear it assigned the subject is admirable and so are many of the details but the whole thing is less simple and complete than either of the three tales of american life and hawthorne forfeited a precious advantage in ceasing to tread his native soil half the virtue of the scarlet letter and the house of the seven gables is in their local quality they are impregnated with the new england air it is very true that hawthorne had no pretension to pourtray actualities and to cultivate that literal exactitude which is now the fashion had this been the case he would probably have made a still graver mistake in transporting the scene of his story to a country which he knew only superficially his tales all go on more or less in the vague as the french say and of course the vague may as well be placed in tuscany as in massachusetts it may also very well be urged in hawthornes favour here that in transformation he has attempted to deal with actualities more than he did in either of his earlier novels he has described the streets and monuments of rome with a closeness which forms no part of his reference to those of boston and salem but for all this he incurs that penalty of seeming factitious and unauthoritative which is always the result of an artists attempt to project himself into an atmosphere in which he has not a transmitted and inherited property an english or a german writer i put poets aside may love italy well enough and know her well enough to write delightful fictions about her the thing has often been done but the productions in question will as novels always have about them something secondrate and imperfect there is in transformation enough beautiful perception of the interesting character of rome enough rich and eloquent expression of it to save the book if the book could be saved but the style what the french call the genre is an inferior one and the thing remains a charming romance with intrinsic weaknesses  allowing for this however some of the finest pages in all hawthorne are to be found in it the subject as i have said is a particularly happy one and there is a great deal of interest in the simple combination and opposition of the four actors it is noticeable that in spite of the considerable length of the story there are no accessory figures donatello and miriam kenyon and hilda exclusively occupy the scene this is the more noticeable as the scene is very large and the great roman background is constantly presented to us the relations of these four people are full of that moral picturesqueness which hawthorne was always looking for he found it in perfection in the history of donatello as i have said the novel is the most popular of his works and every one will remember the figure of the simple joyous sensuous young italian who is not so much a man as a child and not so much a child as a charming innocent animal and how he is brought to selfknowledge and to a miserable conscious manhood by the commission of a crime donatello is rather vague and impalpable he says too little in the book shows himself too little and falls short i think of being a creation but he is enough of a creation to make us enter into the situation and the whole history of his rise or fall whichever one chooses to call ithis tasting of the tree of knowledge and finding existence complicated with a regretis unfolded with a thousand ingenious and exquisite touches of course to make the interest complete there is a woman in the affair and hawthorne has done few things more beautiful than the picture of the unequal complicity of guilt between his immature and dimlypuzzled hero with his clinging unquestioning unexacting devotion and the dark powerful more widelyseeing feminine nature of miriam deeply touching is the representation of the manner in which these two essentially different personsthe woman intelligent passionate acquainted with life and with a tragic element in her own career the youth ignorant gentle unworldly brightly and harmlessly naturalare equalised and bound together by their common secret which insulates them morally from the rest of mankind the character of hilda has always struck me as an admirable inventionone of those things that mark the man of genius it needed a man of genius and of hawthornes imaginative delicacy to feel the propriety of such a figure as hildas and to perceive the relief it would both give and borrow this pure and somewhat rigid new england girl following the vocation of a copyist of pictures in rome unacquainted with evil and untouched by impurity has been accidentally the witness unknown and unsuspected of the dark deed by which her friends miriam and donatello are knit together this is her revelation of evil her loss of perfect innocence she has done no wrong and yet wrongdoing has become a part of her experience and she carries the weight of her detested knowledge upon her heart she carries it a long time saddened and oppressed by it till at last she can bear it no longer if i have called the whole idea of the presence and effect of hilda in the story a trait of genius the purest touch of inspiration is the episode in which the poor girl deposits her burden she has passed the whole lonely summer in rome and one day at the end of it finding herself in st peters she enters a confessional strenuous daughter of the puritans as she is and pours out her dark knowledge into the bosom of the churchthen comes away with her conscience lightened not a whit the less a puritan than before if the book contained nothing else noteworthy but this admirable scene and the pages describing the murder committed by donatello under miriams eyes and the ecstatic wandering afterwards of the guilty couple through the bloodstained streets of rome it would still deserve to rank high among the imaginative productions of our day  like all of hawthornes things it contains a great many light threads of symbolism which shimmer in the texture of the tale but which are apt to break and remain in our fingers if we attempt to handle them these things are part of hawthornes very manneralmost as one might say of his vocabulary they belong much more to the surface of his work than to its stronger interest the fault of transformation is that the element of the unreal is pushed too far and that the book is neither positively of one category nor of another his moonshiny romance he calls it in a letter and in truth the lunar element is a little too pervasive the action wavers between the streets of rome whose literal features the author perpetually sketches and a vague realm of fancy in which quite a different verisimilitude prevails this is the trouble with donatello himself his companions are intended to be realif they fail to be so it is not for want of intention whereas he is intended to be real or not as you please he is of a different substance from them it is as if a painter in composing a picture should try to give you an impression of one of his figures by a strain of music the idea of the modern faun was a charming one but i think it a pity that the author should not have made him more definitely modern without reverting so much to his mythological properties and antecedents which are very gracefully touched upon but which belong to the region of picturesque conceits much more than to that of real psychology among the young italians of today there are still plenty of models for such an image as hawthorne appears to have wished to present in the easy and natural donatello and since i am speaking critically i may go on to say that the art of narration in transformation seems to me more at fault than in the authors other novels the story straggles and wanders is dropped and taken up again and towards the close lapses into an almost fatal vagueness                                          chapter vii  last years   of the four last years of hawthornes life there is not much to tell that i have not already told he returned to america in the summer of 1860 and took up his abode in the house he had bought at concord before going to europe and of which his occupancy had as yet been brief he was to occupy it only four years i have insisted upon the fact of his being an intense american and of his looking at all things during his residence in europe from the standpoint of that little clod of western earth which he carried about with him as the good mohammedan carries the strip of carpet on which he kneels down to face towards mecca but it does not appear nevertheless that he found himself treading with any great exhilaration the larger section of his native soil upon which on his return he disembarked indeed the closing part of his life was a period of dejection the more acute that it followed directly upon seven years of the happiest opportunities he was to have known and his european residence had been brightest at the last he had broken almost completely with those habits of extreme seclusion into which he was to relapse on his return to concord you would be stricken dumb he wrote from london shortly before leaving it for the last time to see how quietly i accept a whole string of invitations and what is more perform my engagements without a murmur the stir of this london life somehow or other he adds in the same letter has done me a wonderful deal of good and i feel better than for months past this is strange for if i had my choice i should leave undone almost all the things i do when he found himself once more on the old ground writes mr lathrop with the old struggle for subsistence staring him in the face again it is not difficult to conceive how a certain degree of depression would follow there is indeed not a little sadness in the thought of hawthornes literary gift light delicate exquisite capricious never too abundant being charged with the heavy burden of the maintenance of a family we feel that it was not intended for such grossness and that in a world ideally constituted he would have enjoyed a liberal pension an assured subsistence and have been able to produce his charming prose only when the fancy took him  the brightness of the outlook at home was not made greater by the explosion of the civil war in the spring of 1861 these months and the three years that followed them were not a cheerful time for any persons but armycontractors but over hawthorne the warcloud appears to have dropped a permanent shadow the whole affair was a bitter disappointment to him and a fatal blow to that happy faith in the uninterruptedness of american prosperity which i have spoken of as the religion of the oldfashioned american in general and the oldfashioned democrat in particular it was not a propitious time for cultivating the muse when history herself is so hard at work fiction has little left to say to fiction directly hawthorne did not address himself he composed first chiefly during the year 1862 the chapters of which our our old home was afterwards made up i have said that though this work has less value than his purely imaginative things the writing is singularly good and it is well to remember to its greater honour that it was produced at a time when it was painfully hard for a man of hawthornes cast of mind to fix his attention the air was full of battlesmoke and the poets vision was not easily clear hawthorne was irritated too by the sense of being to a certain extent politically considered in a false position a large section of the democratic party was not in good odour at the north its loyalty was not perceived to be of that clear strain which public opinion required to this wing of the party franklin pierce had with reason or without the credit of belonging and our author was conscious of some sharpness of responsibility in defending the illustrious friend of whom he had already made himself the advocate he defended him manfully without a grain of concession and described the expresident to the public and to himself if not as he was then as he ought to be our old home is dedicated to him and about this dedication there was some little difficulty it was represented to hawthorne that as general pierce was rather out of fashion it might injure the success and in plain terms the sale of his book his answer to his publisher was much to the point       i find that it would be a piece of poltroonery in me to      withdraw either the dedication or the dedicatory letter my      long and intimate personal relations with pierce render the      dedication altogether proper especially as regards this      book which would have had no existence without his      kindness and if he is so exceedingly unpopular that his      name ought to sink the volume there is so much the more      need that an old friend should stand by him i cannot      merely on account of pecuniary profit or literary      reputation go back from what i have deliberately felt and      thought it right to do and if i were to tear out the      dedication i should never look at the volume again without      remorse and shame as for the literary public it must      accept my book precisely as i think fit to give it or let      it alone nevertheless i have no fancy for making myself a      martyr when it is honourably and conscientiously possible to      avoid it and i always measure out heroism very accurately      according to the exigencies of the occasion and should be      the last man in the world to throw away a bit of it      needlessly so i have looked over the concluding paragraph      and have amended it in such a way that while doing what i      know to be justice to my friend it contains not a word that      ought to be objectionable to any set of readers if the      public of the north see fit to ostracise me for this i can      only say that i would gladly sacrifice a thousand or two      dollars rather than retain the goodwill of such a herd of      dolts and meanspirited scoundrels  the dedication was published the book was eminently successful and hawthorne was not ostracised the paragraph under discussion stands as followsonly this let me say that with the record of your life in my memory and with a sense of your character in my deeper consciousness as among the few things that time has left as it found them i need no assurance that you continue faithful for ever to that grand idea of an irrevocable union which as you once told me was the earliest that your brave father taught you for other men there may be a choice of pathsfor you but one and it rests among my certainties that no mans loyalty is more steadfast no mans hopes or apprehensions on behalf of our national existence more deeply heartfelt or more closely intertwined with his possibilities of personal happiness than those of franklin pierce i know not how well the expresident liked these lines but the public thought them admirable for they served as a kind of formal profession of faith on the question of the hour by a loved and honoured writer that some of his friends thought such a profession needed is apparent from the numerous editorial ejaculations and protests appended to an article describing a visit he had just paid to washington which hawthorne contributed to the atlantic monthly for july 1862 and which singularly enough has not been reprinted the article has all the usual merit of such sketches on hawthornes partthe merit of delicate sportive feeling expressed with consummate gracebut the editor of the periodical appears to have thought that he must give the antidote with the poison and the paper is accompanied with several little notes disclaiming all sympathy with the writers political heresies the heresies strike the reader of today as extremely mild and what excites his emotion rather is the questionable taste of the editorial commentary with which it is strange that hawthorne should have allowed his article to be encumbered he had not been an abolitionist before the war and that he should not pretend to be one at the eleventh hour was for instance surely a piece of consistency that might have been allowed to pass i shall not pretend to be an admirer of old john brown he says in a page worth quoting any further than sympathy with whittiers excellent ballad about him may go nor did i expect ever to shrink so unutterably from any apophthegm of a sage whose happy lips have uttered a hundred golden sentencesthe allusion here i suppose is to mr emersonas from that saying perhaps falsely attributed to so honoured a name that the death of this bloodstained fanatic has made the gallows as venerable as the cross nobody was ever more justly hanged he won his martyrdom fairly and took it fairly he himself i am persuaded such was his natural integrity would have acknowledged that virginia had a right to take the life which he had staked and lost although it would have been better for her in the hour that is fast coming if she could generously have forgotten the criminality of his attempt in its enormous folly on the other hand any commonsensible man looking at the matter unsentimentally must have felt a certain intellectual satisfaction in seeing him hanged if it were only in requital of his preposterous miscalculation of possibilities now that the heat of that great conflict has passed away this is a capital expression of the saner estimate in the united states of the dauntless and deluded old man who proposed to solve a complex political problem by stirring up a servile insurrection there is much of the same sound sense interfused with light just appreciable irony in such a passage as the following       i tried to imagine how very disagreeable the presence of a      southern army would be in a sober town of massachusetts and      the thought considerably lessened my wonder at the cold and      shy regards that are cast upon our troops the gloom the      sullen demeanour the declared or scarcely hidden sympathy      with rebellion which are so frequent here it is a strange      thing in human life that the greatest errors both of men      and women often spring from their sweetest and most generous      qualities and so undoubtedly thousands of warmhearted      generous and impulsive persons have joined the rebels not      from any real zeal for the cause but because between two      conflicting loyalties they chose that which necessarily lay      nearest the heart there never existed any other government      against which treason was so easy and could defend itself      by such plausible arguments as against that of the united      states the anomaly of two allegiances of which that of      the state comes nearest home to a mans feelings and      includes the altar and the hearth while the general      government claims his devotion only to an airy mode of law      and has no symbol but a flag is exceedingly mischievous in      this point of view for it has converted crowds of honest      people into traitors who seem to themselves not merely      innocent but patriotic and who die for a bad cause with a      quiet conscience as if it were the best in the vast extent      of our countrytoo vast by far to be taken into one small      human heartwe inevitably limit to our own state or at      farthest to our own little section that sentiment of      physical love for the soil which renders an englishman for      example so intensely sensitive to the dignity and      wellbeing of his little island that one hostile foot      treading anywhere upon it would make a bruise on each      individual breast if a man loves his own state therefore      and is content to be ruined with her let us shoot him if      we can but allow him an honourable burial in the soil he      fights for  to this paragraph a line of deprecation from the editor is attached and indeed from the point of view of a vigorous prosecution of the war it was doubtless not particularly pertinent but it is interesting as an example of the way an imaginative man judges current eventstrying to see the other side as well as his own to feel what his adversary feels and present his view of the case  but he had other occupations for his imagination than putting himself into the shoes of unappreciative southerners he began at this time two novels neither of which he lived to finish but both of which were published as fragments after his death the shorter of these fragments to which he had given the name of the dolliver romance is so very brief that little can be said of it the author strikes with all his usual sweetness the opening notes of a story of new england life and the few pages which have been given to the world contain a charming picture of an old man and a child  the other rough sketchit is hardly moreis in a manner complete it was unfortunately deemed complete enough to be brought out in a magazine as a serial novel this was to do it a great wrong and i do not go too far in saying that poor hawthorne would probably not have enjoyed the very bright light that has been projected upon this essentially crude piece of work i am at a loss to know how to speak of septimius felton or the elixir of life i have purposely reserved but a small space for doing so for the part of discretion seems to be to pass it by lightly i differ therefore widely from the authors biographer and soninlaw in thinking it a work of the greatest weight and value offering striking analogies with goethes faust and still more widely from a critic whom mr lathrop quotes who regards a certain portion of it as one of the very greatest triumphs in all literature it seems to me almost cruel to pitch in this exalted key ones estimate of the rough first draught of a tale in regard to which the authors premature death operates virtually as a complete renunciation of pretensions it is plain to any reader that septimius felton as it stands with its roughness its gaps its mere allusiveness and slightness of treatment gives us but a very partial measure of hawthornes full intention and it is equally easy to believe that this intention was much finer than anything we find in the book even if we possessed the novel in its complete form however i incline to think that we should regard it as very much the weakest of hawthornes productions the idea itself seems a failure and the best that might have come of it would have been very much below the scarlet letter or the house of the seven gables the appeal to our interest is not felicitously made and the fancy of a potion to assure eternity of existence being made from the flowers which spring from the grave of a man whom the distiller of the potion has deprived of life though it might figure with advantage in a short story of the pattern of the twicetold tales appears too slender to carry the weight of a novel indeed this whole matter of elixirs and potions belongs to the fairytale period of taste and the idea of a young man enabling himself to live forever by concocting and imbibing a magic draught has the misfortune of not appealing to our sense of reality or even to our sympathy the weakness of septimius felton is that the reader cannot take the hero seriouslya fact of which there can be no better proof than the element of the ridiculous which inevitably mingles itself in the scene in which he entertains his ladylove with a prophetic sketch of his occupations during the successive centuries of his earthly immortality i suppose the answer to my criticism is that this is allegorical symbolic ideal but we feel that it symbolises nothing substantial and that the truthwhatever it may bethat it illustrates is as moonshiny to use hawthornes own expression as the allegory itself another fault of the story is that a great historical eventthe war of the revolutionis introduced in the first few pages in order to supply the hero with a pretext for killing the young man from whose grave the flower of immortality is to sprout and then drops out of the narrative altogether not even forming a background to the sequel it seems to me that hawthorne should either have invented some other occasion for the death of his young officer or else having struck the note of the great public agitation which overhung his little group of characters have been careful to sound it through the rest of his tale i do wrong however to insist upon these things for i fall thereby into the error of treating the work as if it had been cast into its ultimate form and acknowledged by the author to avoid this error i shall make no other criticism of details but content myself with saying that the idea and intention of the book appear relatively speaking feeble and that even had it been finished it would have occupied a very different place in the public esteem from the writers masterpieces  the year 1864 brought with it for hawthorne a sense of weakness and depression from which he had little relief during the four or five months that were left him of life he had his engagement to produce the dolliver romance which had been promised to the subscribers of the atlantic monthly it was the first time he had undertaken to publish a work of fiction in monthly parts but he was unable to write and his consciousness of an unperformed task weighed upon him and did little to dissipate his physical inertness i have not yet had courage to read the dolliver proofsheet he wrote to his publisher in december 1863 but will set about it soon though with terrible reluctance such as i never felt before i am most grateful to you he went on for protecting me from that visitation of the elephant and his cub if you happen to see mr of l a young man who was here last summer pray tell him anything that your conscience will let you to induce him to spare me another visit which i know he intended i really am not well and cannot be disturbed by strangers without more suffering than it is worth while to endure a month later he was obliged to ask for a further postponement i am not quite up to writing yet but shall make an effort as soon as i see any hope of success you ought to be thankful that like most other brokendown authors i do not pester you with decrepit pages and insist upon your accepting them as full of the old spirit and vigour that trouble perhaps still awaits you after i shall have reached a further stage of decay seriously my mind has for the time lost its temper and its fine edge and i have an instinct that i had better keep quiet perhaps i shall have a new spirit of vigour if i wait quietly for it perhaps not the winter passed away but the new spirit of vigour remained absent and at the end of february he wrote to mr fields that his novel had simply broken down and that he should never finish it i hardly know what to say to the public about this abortive romance though i know pretty well what the case will be i shall never finish it yet it is not quite pleasant for an author to announce himself or to be announced as finally broken down as to his literary faculty i cannot finish it unless a great change comes over me and if i make too great an effort to do so it will be my death not that i should care much for that if i could fight the battle through and win it thus ending a life of much smoulder and a scanty fire in a blaze of glory but i should smother myself in mud of my own making i am not lowspirited nor fanciful nor freakish but look what seem to me realities in the face and am ready to take whatever may come if i could but go to england now i think that the seavoyage and the old home might set me all right  but he was not to go to england he started three months later upon a briefer journey from which he never returned his health was seriously disordered and in april according to a letter from mrs hawthorne printed by mr fields he had been miserably ill his feebleness was complete he appears to have had no definite malady but he was according to the common phrase failing general pierce proposed to him that they should make a little tour together among the mountains of new hampshire and hawthorne consented in the hope of getting some profit from the change of air the northern new england spring is not the most genial season in the world and this was an indifferent substitute for the resource for which his wife had on his behalf expressed a wisha visit to some island in the gulf stream he was not to go far he only reached a little place called plymouth one of the stations of approach to the beautiful mountain scenery of new hampshire when on the 18th of may 1864 death overtook him his companion general pierce going into his room in the early morning found that he had breathed his last during the nighthad passed away tranquilly comfortably without a sign or a sound in his sleep this happened at the hotel of the placea vast white edifice adjacent to the railway station and entitled the pemigiwasset house he was buried at concord and many of the most distinguished men in the country stood by his grave  he was a beautiful natural original genius and his life had been singularly exempt from worldly preoccupations and vulgar efforts it had been as pure as simple as unsophisticated as his work he had lived primarily in his domestic affections which were of the tenderest kind and thenwithout eagerness without pretension but with a great deal of quiet devotionin his charming art his work will remain it is too original and exquisite to pass away among the men of imagination he will always have his niche no one has had just that vision of life and no one has had a literary form that more successfully expressed his vision he was not a moralist and he was not simply a poet the moralists are weightier denser richer in a sense the poets are more purely inconclusive and irresponsible he combined in a singular degree the spontaneity of the imagination with a haunting care for moral problems mans conscience was his theme but he saw it in the light of a creative fancy which added out of its own substance an interest and i may almost say an importance  the end
