73477705	glasses   chapter i   yes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of the thread and let it lead me back to the first impression  the little story is all there i can touch it from point to point for the thread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string  none of the beads are missingat least i think theyre not thats exactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out  i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to folkestone for a blow  art was long i felt and my holiday short my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visit when i could  i remember how on this occasion after weeks in my stuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea  the place was full of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full of people people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another on the great flat down  there were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses  we all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level cliff top edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship  there were old folks in bath chairs and there was one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side of which i always walked  there was in fine weather the coast of france to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate  the widow of an officer in the engineers she had settled like many members of the martial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with my mother she was the heartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune  she carried it high aloft with loud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as if it had been the flag of her country  it consisted mainly of a big red face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared at you through goldrimmed aids to vision optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of her spectacles  she was extraordinarily nearsighted and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them  blest conveniences they were in their hideous honest strengththey showed the good lady everything in the world but her own queerness  this element was enhanced by wild braveries of dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances of cut wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed to lay down its life  she had the tread of a grenadier and the voice of an angel  in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i found myself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity  i had been struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i was still more affected when i saw the face at the sight of my companion open like a window thrown wide  a smile fluttered out of it an brightly as a drapery dropped from a silla drapery shaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked by two young men a wonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace  my immediate impression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning but during the few moments she stood talking with our friend i made more discoveries  the figure from the neck down was meagre the stature insignificant but the desire to please towered high as well as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never never missing it  this was a little person whom i would have made a high bid for a good chance to paint  the head the features the colour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyesthe most agreeable i thought that i had ever seenbrushed with a kind of winglike grace every object they encountered  their possessor was just back from boulogne where she had spent a week with dear mrs floydtaylor this accounted for the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum  her black garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested a pink andwhite wreath at a showy funeral  she confounded us for three minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the great conscious public responsible order  the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few moments of the day at which young men these or others would not be so occupied  the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape  when she brought her face close to mrs meldrumsand she appeared to be always bringing it close to somebodysit was a marvel that objects so dissimilar should express the same general identity the unmistakable character of the english gentlewoman  mrs meldrum sustained the comparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didnt introduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing of such a face close to mine  however by the time the young lady moved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense that some such rapprochement might still occur  was this by reason of the general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason of a subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created  i was in a position to answer that question after mrs meldrum had answered a few of mine     chapter ii   flora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both her parents her mother within a few months  mrs meldrum had known them disapproved of them considerably avoided them she had watched the girl off and on from her early childhood  flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the worldso alone that she had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger mrs hammond synge the sisterinlaw of one of the young men i had just seen  she had lots of friends but none of them nice she kept picking up impossible people  the floydtaylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid  the hammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had no conscience in their dealings with her  she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeed she knows what i think of most things  she shares that privilege with most of your friends i replied laughing  no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little difference  that girl doesnt care a button  she knows best of all what i think of flora saunt  and what may your opinion be  why that shes not worth troubling aboutan idiot too abysmal  doesnt she care for that  just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out  shes too pleased with herself for anything else to matter  surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to be pleased with  so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i had given you the chance  however that doesnt signify either for her vanity is beyond all making or mending  she believes in herself and shes welcome after all poor dear having only herself to look to  ive seldom met a young woman more completely free to be silly  she has a clear courseshell make a showy finish  well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to the same degraded state her partaking of it wont stand out so much  if you mean that the worlds full of twaddlers i quite agree with you cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across the channel  i had after this to consider a little what she would call my mothers son but i didnt let it prevent me from insisting on her making me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull by the horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity now demanded of her to put into relation with a character really fine  such a frail creature was just an object of pity  this contention on my part had at first of course been jocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myself taking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her  i couldnt have said what i felt about her except that she was undefended from the first of my sitting with her there after dinner under the starsthat was a week at folkestone of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded chairsi became aware both that protection was wholly absent from her life and that she was wholly indifferent to its absence  the odd thing was that she was not appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdly fantastically pleased  her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in  mrs meldrum told me more about her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group of giggling nudging spectators flora wasnt ready to tell about herself  she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in all promiscuities  it was an effect of these things that from the very first with every one listening i could mention that my main business with her would be just to have a go at her head and to arrange in that view for an early sitting  it would have been as impossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have been to throw a stone at a plateglass window so any talk that went forward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thing in the world and immediately became the most general and sociable  it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was the last thing she asked for what one would ever most have at her service was a curious compassion  that sentiment was coloured by the vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put so off her guard  hers was the only vanity i have ever known that made its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrums further information contributed moreover to these indulgencesher account of the girls neglected childhood and queer continental relegations with straying squabbling montecarlohaunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniary arrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her outpractically she went out alonehad their hands half the time in her pocket  she had to pay for everything down to her share of the winebills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synges fare in the underground when he went to the city for her  she had been left with just money enough to turn her head and it hadnt even been put in trust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it  she could spend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainly wouldnt last very long  couldnt you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as you are i asked of mrs meldrum  youre probably with one exception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldnt scandalously fleece her  how do you know what i wouldnt do my humorous friend demanded  of course ive thought how i can help herit has kept me awake at night but doing its impossible shell take nothing from me  you know what she doesshe hugs me and runs away  she has an instinct about me and feels that ive one about her  and then she dislikes me for another reason that im not quite clear about but that im well aware of and that i shall find out some day  so far as her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field  she must live in londonher game is there  so she takes the line of adoring me of saying she can never forget that i was devoted to her motherwhich i wouldnt for the world have beenand of giving me a wide berth  i think she positively dislikes to look at me  its all right theres no obligation though people in general cant take their eyes off me  i see that at this moment i replied  but what does it matter where or how for the present she lives  shell marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change  whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked  any one she likes  shes so abnormally pretty that she can do anything shell fascinate some nabob or some prince  shell fascinate him first and bore him afterwards  moreover shes not so pretty as you make her out she hasnt a scrap of a figure  no doubt but one doesnt in the least miss it  not now said mrs meldrum but one will when shes older and when everything will have to count  when shes older shell count as a princess so it wont matter  she has other drawbacks my companion went on  those wonderful eyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugarballswhich they greatly resemblein a childs mouth  she cant use them  use them  why she does nothing else  to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to do any sort of work  she never opens a book and her maid writes her notes  youll say that those who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones  of course i know that if i didnt wear my goggles i shouldnt be good for much  do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things i exclaimed with more horror than i meant to show  i dont prescribe for her i dont know that theyre what she requires  whats the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment  i dont exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago that even as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles and that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful  im sure i hope she is  i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this made upon memy immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal to floras own  i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in my hand     chapter iii   this conversation occurred the night before i went back to town  i settled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still my morning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of it i was out with my mother  every one in the place was as usual out with some one else and even had i been free to go and take leave of her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be at home  just where she was i presently discovered she was at the far end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of sandgate and hythe  her back however was turned to this attraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears on the high rail that inclosed the down  two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldnt see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figurepiece submitted to them  i was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness her eternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foregroundi was reminded anew i say how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didnt explain and that the mention of her lapses didnt affect  where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was right everything did  i say she was wanting in mystery but that after all was her secret  this happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trust to make the world good for them  i wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chair stood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her  in this way i saw that if one of floras attendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master of ceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personage i had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained  i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender i scarce know why unless because of the motive i felt in the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of impertinence but it didnt matter for flora came away with alacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance  she seated herself on the floor of my mothers chair a little too much on her right instep as i afterwards gathered caressing her still hand smiling up into her cold face commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt  she told her immediately as if it were something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit to me for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to enquire if it would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers  her lips at this parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadowpatches on the sea  she showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for the inconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight  i had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her but that didnt seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquiring who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be  oh a gentleman i met at boulogne  he has come over to see me  after a moment she added lord iffield  i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his having been at boulogne helped me to give him a niche  mrs meldrum had incidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floydtaylor floras recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for their leisure  she had always one or other in hand and had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite coast  i had a vague idea that boulogne was not a resort of the worlds envied at the same time there might very well have been a strong attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune  i could perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt  but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what was uppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort of keeping insisted just then on coming out  is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that youre so unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes  i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back her head changing colour from brow to chin  true  who in the world says so  i repented of my question in a flash the way she met it made it seem cruel and i felt my mother look at me in some surprise  i took care in answer to floras challenge not to incriminate mrs meldrum  i answered that the rumour had reached me only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put it to the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible  her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistened in its track  if you ever hear such a thing said again you can say its a horrid lie  i had brought on a commotion deeper than any i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by the next words she uttered im happy to say theres nothing the matter with any part of me whatever not the least little thing  she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see how she wished that she hadnt so taken me up  she turned it off with a laugh  ive good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper  im sound of wind and limb  nothing could have been more characteristic than her blush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect in every particular  she couldnt submit to the imputation of a flaw  i expressed my delight in what she told me assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mothers toes  the young men presented their backs to us they were leaning on the rail of the cliff  our incident had produced a certain awkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say she exclaimed irrelevantly dont you know  hell be lord considine  at that moment the youth marked for this high destiny turned round and she spoke to my mother  ill introduce him to youhes awfully nice  she beckoned and invited him with her parasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted  i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to place lord iffield it was because i didnt know the name of his eldest son  the young man took no notice of miss saunts appeal he only stared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned his back  she was an odd creature she didnt blush at this she only said to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetest amusement you dont mind do you  hes a monster of shyness  it was as if she were sorry for every onefor lord iffield the victim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the subject of a certain slight  im sure i dont want him said my mother but flora added some promise of how she would handle him for his rudeness  she would clearly never explain anything by any failure of her own appeal  there rolled over me while she took leave of us and floated back to her friends a wave of superstitious dread  i seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and such joy  i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that i shouldnt like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that the girl mightnt miss her possible fortune     chapter iv   one day in the course of the following june there was ushered into my studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i had been very briefly in correspondence  a letter from him had expressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of miss flora louisa saunt whose full name figured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of the academy had found a purchaser before the close of the private view  he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at his service some other memorial of the same lovely head some preliminary sketch some study for the picture  i had replied that i had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he were interested in my work i should be happy to show him what i had done  mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal soundsa long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexion and large protrusive teeth  he bore in its most indelible pressure the postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened his mouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registered envelope  he was full of refinements and angles of dreary and distinguished knowledge  of his unconscious drollery his dress freely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his red necktie was passed to the square toecaps of his boots to conform with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last  there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestive stammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of his errand and the expression of his good green eyes  as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he needed explaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken as he said a tremendous fancy to her looks  i ought doubtless to have been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of them a judgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quite leaving out the element of art  he was like the innocent reader for whom the story is really true and the author a negligible quantity  he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had never seen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldnt be more to the point to deal directly with the lady  he stared and blushed at this the idea clearly alarmed him  he was an extraordinary casepersonally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him  he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content just to dream of what it stood for  he was the young prince in the legend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of the princess beyond seas  until i knew him better this puzzled me muchthe link was so missing between his sensibility and his type  he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in the beholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference so arbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed his wish to possess it and fell into the extremity of confusion over the question of price  i helped him over that stile and he went off without having asked me a direct question about miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm  his delicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to be limited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original of the picture  there were othersfor i was curious about himthat i wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of his carrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back  to ensure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectly recall the impulse that made me forbear  it operated suddenly from within while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle grin  if he was smitten with floras ghost what mightnt be the direct force of the luminary that could cast such a shadow  this source of radiance flooding my poor place might very well happen to be present the next time he should turn up  the idea was sharp within me that there were relations and complications it was no mission of mine to bring about  if they were to develop they should develop in their very own sense  let me say at once that they did develop and that i perhaps after all had something to do with it  if mr dawling had departed without a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection no less powerful than that of our young lady herself  i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown to regard my studio as the temple of her beauty  this miracle was recorded and celebrated there as nowhere else in other places there was occasional reference to other subjects of remark  the degree of her presumption continued to be stupefying there was nothing so extraordinary save the degree in which she never paid for it  she was kept innocent that is she was kept safe by her egotism but she was helped also though she had now put off her mourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a law unto herself  it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as a lone orphan that she was the centre of a crush  the neglect of the hammond synges gave relief to this character and she made it worth their while to be as every one said too shocking  lord iffield had gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for the punctual private view it was he who had snapped up as flora called it the gem of the exhibition  my hope for the girls future had slipped ignominiously off his back but after his purchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith  the girls own faith was wonderful  it couldnt however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values  her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night  how indeed could a person speak the truth who was always posturing and bragging  she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i had mastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in a single line i was decidedly tired of its purity which affected me at last as inane  one moved with her moreover among phenomena mismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched anything out of it  lord iffield was dying of love for her but his family was leading him a life  his mother horrid woman had told some one that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger than marry a girl not absolutely one of themselves  he had given his young friend unmistakable signs but was lying low gaining time it was in his fathers power to be both in personal and in pecuniary ways excessively nasty to him  his father wouldnt last for everquite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spite of her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some of them positively threatening in their passion he could trust her to hold out  there were richer cleverer men there were greater personages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her there so gratefully to rest upon  she came back to me with tale upon tale and it all might be or mightnt  i never met my pretty model in the worldshe moved it appeared in exalted circlesand could only admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of her life and the freedom of her hand  i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of such patience asking me indeed more questions about him than i could answer then she had capped my anecdote with others much more striking the disclosure of effects produced in the most extraordinary quarters on people who had followed her into railway carriages guards and porters even who had literally stuck there others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about her house door cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze their fill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction through the very glasses of fourwheelers  she lost herself in these reminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling was only one of a million  when therefore the next autumn she flourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels her first care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitude it wasnt because she had run after him  dawling explained with a hundred grins that when one wished very much to get anything one usually ended by doing soa proposition which led me wholly to dissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadnt in the least wished to get mr dawling  she mightnt have wished to get him but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if she could treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb  true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe of scalps  much at any rate would have come and gone since our separation in july  she had spent four months abroad where on swiss and italian lakes in german cities in the french capital many accidents might have happened     chapter v   i had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and the gleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources and pastimes  mrs meldrum much edified by my report of the performances as she called them in my studio had told me that to her knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut from her capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing more left to swallow  perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzled me as usual by her universal light she knew so much more about everything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of my colourtubes  she knew that flora was acting on system and absolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoning was that her money would last as long as she should need it that a magnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should be really pinched  she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for the approaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in which she would most naturally meet her match  lord iffield had been seen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrums conviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the most futile flirtation  the girl had a certain hold of him but with a great deal of swagger he hadnt the spirit of a sheep he was in fear of his father and would never commit himself in lord considines lifetime  the most flora might achieve was that he wouldnt marry some one else  geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrums knowledge i had told her of the young mans visit had attached himself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group  my informant was in a position to be definite about this dangler she knew about his people she had heard of him before  hadnt he been a friend of one of her nephews at oxford hadnt he spent the christmas holidays precisely three years before at her brotherinlaws in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refused with derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her to complain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as an appendage of floras was one of those oftcited proofs that the world is small and that there are not enough people to go round  his father had been something or other in the treasury his grandfather on the mothers side had been something or other in the church  he had come into the paternal estate two or three thousand a year in hampshire but he had let the place advantageously and was generous to four plain sisters who lived at bournemouth and adored him  the family was hideous all round but the very salt of the earth  he was supposed to be unspeakably clever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectual society and of the idea of a political career  that such a man should be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as the phrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of his inclinations  i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her than of all the other things together  betty one of five and with views above her station was at any rate felt at home to have dished herself by her perversity  of course no one had looked at her since and no one would ever look at her again  it would be eminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of bettys fate  i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by any symptom on our young ladys part of that sort of meditation  the one moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable aspect which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and the cabmen by the doomdealing gods had followed from london to venice and from venice back to london again  i afterwards learned that her version of this episode was profusely inexact his personal acquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkable enough i admit in connexion with what had gone beforea coincidence at all events superficially striking  at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he had found himself at the table dhote of his inn opposite to the full presentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made him dream and desire  he had been tossed by it to a height so vertiginous as to involve a retreat from the board but the next day he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of his apparition  on the following with an equal incoherence a sacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind he made an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which he had already felt the cold breath  that fate in london very little later drove him straight before itdrove him one sunday afternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges  he marched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow him to pieces  but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsed since then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carry for the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back  i dont mean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope i mean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which as the event was to show couldnt have been bettered as a means of securing him  she hadnt calculated but she had said never and that word had made a bed big enough for his longlegged patience  he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in the piece  now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedly knocked at my door  what he brought with him on these occasions was a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seem even now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs  that was really what i saw of him in the light of his behaviour  he had fallen in love as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of a sort that would make him permanently lame  it was the whole man who limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the same position as before  the tremendous cleverness the literary society the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemed to flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor  i hadnt had an oxford training and i had never encountered the great man at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and who had addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i remember asking myself how effectively this privilege had supposed itself to prepare him for the career on which my friend appeared now to have embarked  i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even its critics but from which the friction of mere personal intercourse was not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark  he accepted without a question both his fever and his chill and the only thing he touched with judgment was this convenience of my friendship  he doubtless told me his simple story but the matter comes back in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece of my having had to put it together for him  he took it from me in this form without a groan and i gave it him quite as it came he took it again and again spending his odd halfhours with me as if for the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love  he told me i made him see things to begin with hadnt i first made him see flora saunt  i wanted him to give her up and lucidly informed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake of the point that he wouldnt  he simply and pointlessly didnt and when at the end of three months i asked him what was the use of talking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justification was to say that what made him want to help her was just the deficiencies i dwelt on  i could only reply without gross developments oh if youre as sorry for her as that  i too was nearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrier still for other victims of this compassion  with dawling as with me the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive so that when eventually the motive was supplied each could to a certain extent compliment the other on the fineness of his foresight  after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to put pressure on her to marry him  she didnt know i would take it that way else she would never have brought him to see me  it was in her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness i asked him at last to sit to me  i dare say moreover she was disgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as many sketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers  what was the value of tributes to beauty by a hand that could so abase itself  my relation to poor dawlings want of modelling was simple enough  i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasure of his soul     chapter vi   it befell at this period just before christmas that on my having gone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy or two my eyes fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on the bright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held its own even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developed dolls  a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well as with purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations  i was just about to appeal to flora to avert that stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by a gentleman whose identity though more than a year had elapsed came back to me from the folkestone cliff  it had been associated on that scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed more splendidly into a furtrimmed overcoat  lord iffields presence made me waver an instant before crossing over and during that instant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were after all weary of alternatives looked straight across at me  i was on the point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her face gave no sign  i was exactly in the line of her vision but she either didnt see me or didnt recognise me or else had a reason to pretend she didnt  was her reason that i had displeased her and that she wished to punish me  i had always thought it one of her merits that she wasnt vindictive  she at any rate simply looked away and at this moment one of the shopgirls who had apparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a small mechanical toy  it so happened that i followed closely what then took place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by an impression of which in the act i was not fully conscious  flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion then seeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she moved away with the shopgirl who had evidently offered to conduct her into the presence of more objects of the same sort  when she reached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observe her  she had asked some question about the working of the toy and the girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret  flora bent her head over it but she clearly didnt understand  i saw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glance back at the place from which she had come  lord iffield was talking with another young person she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her own attendant  she then drew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her back to me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over the small object the girl had attempted to explain  she took it again and after a moment with her face well averted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck of her head  these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to notice lord iffields whereabouts  he had rejoined her he was close upon her before i knew it or before she knew it herself  i felt at that instant the strangest of all promptings if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give flora a caution  in fact as it was i think i could have done this in time had i not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse  there were three seconds during which i saw the young man and yet let him come on  didnt i make the quick calculation that if he didnt catch what flora was doing i too might perhaps not catch it  she at any rate herself took the alarm  on perceiving her companions nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that i hear at this hour  lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him  then it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisite creature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big black rimmed eyeglasses defacing her by their position crookedly astride of her beautiful nose  she made a grab at them with her free hand while i turned confusedly away     chapter vii   i dont remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling his sittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time he gave me one  has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunts having anything the matter with her eyes  he stared with a candour that was a sufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked and mystified never  then i asked him if he had observed in her any symptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after a moments thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened a train  shes not a bit myopic he said she doesnt blink or contract her lids  i fully recognised this and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry i gave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me at the shop  he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman had figured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injurious rival poor dawlings contention was that if there had been a definite engagement between his lordship and the young lady the sort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciation and retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that having waited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as if the door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruelly locked  he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and still more with my interpretation of it  there is something there is somethingpossibly something very grave certainly something that requires she should make use of artificial aids  she wont admit it publicly because with her idolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she sees in such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement  she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough for the affection she suffers from apparently some definite menace has lately grown much worse  she looked straight at me in the shop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i  at the same distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantly denied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people  at present she couldnt really make out anything the shopgirl showed her  she has successfully concealed from the man i saw her with that she resorts in private to a pincenez and that she does so not only under the strictest orders from her oculist but because literally the poor thing cant accomplish without such help half the business of life iffield however has suspected something and his suspicions whether expressed or kept to himself have put him on the watch  i happened to have a glimpse of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in the act  i had thought it all out my idea explained many things and dawling turned pale as he listened to me  was he rough with her he anxiously asked  how can i tell what passed between them  i fled from the place  my companion stared  do you mean to say her eyesights going  heaven forbid  in that case how could she take life as she does  how does she take life  thats the question  he sat there bewilderedly brooding the tears rose to his lids they reminded me of those i had seen in floras the day i risked my enquiry  the question he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i was ready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that my reflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished at their ingenuity  for the present i only rejoined that it struck me she was playing a particular game at which he went on as if he hadnt heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the dark possibility  do you mean theres a danger of anything very bad  my dear fellow you must ask her special adviser  who in the world is her special adviser  i havent a conception  but we mustnt get too excited  my impression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinary rules to exercise a little common sense  dawling jumped at this  i seeto stick to the pincenez  to follow to the letter her oculists prescription whatever it is and at whatever cost to her prettiness  its not a thing to be trifled with  upon my honour it shant be he roundly declared and he adjusted himself to his position again as if we had quite settled the business after a considerable interval while i botched away he suddenly said did they make a great difference  a great difference  those things she had put on  oh the glassesin her beauty  she looked queer of course but it was partly because one was unaccustomed  there are women who look charming in nippers  what at any rate if she does look queer  she must be mad not to accept that alternative  she is mad said geoffrey dawling  mad to refuse you i grant  besides i went on the pincenez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had half pulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson she was angry  it must have been horrible my companion groaned  it was horrible  but its still more horrible to defy all warnings its still more horrible to be landed in  without saying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders  after a glance at me dawling jerked round  then you do believe that she may be  i hesitated  the thing would be to make her believe it  she only needs a good scare  but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take  oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity  i dont suppose iffield is absolutely a brute  i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare cried geoffrey dawling  i had an impression that iffield wouldnt but i didnt communicate it for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed too much for the purposes of my sitting  i recollect that i did some good work that morning but it also comes back to me that before we separated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious and unregistered had covered with light the subject of our colloquy  he had had a formless perception of some secret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more he thought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didnt and of cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw  when one pieced things together it was astonishing what ground they covered  just as he was going away he asked me from what source at folkestone the horrid tale had proceeded  when i had given him as i saw no reason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh i know all about her shes a friend of some friends of mine  at this i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew some one who would probably prove more wilful still     chapter viii   a few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and even before he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell  ive been down to folkestoneit was necessary i should see her  i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was at any rate out of breath with his news which it took me however a minute to apply  you mean that youve been with mrs meldrum  yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it  it worked upon me awfullyi mean what you told me  he made a visible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed me sufficiently that he had not been reassured  i laid to comfort him and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and he dropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distended look which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that was to come  i knownow he said with an emphasis he rarely used  what then did mrs meldrum tell you  only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge  but that one thing was everything  what is it then  why that she cant bear the sight of her  his pronouns required some arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them i replied that i was quite aware of miss saunts trick of turning her back on the good lady of folkestone  only what did that prove  have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke  dawling towered over me in dismal triumph  it was the first time in our acquaintance that on any ground of understanding this had occurred but even so remarkable an incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect of those spectacles  i seemed to catch the tail of his idea  mrs meldrums  theyre so awfully ugly and they add so to the dear womans ugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quickly added she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was so immediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth  while i tried to fix this sudden image of floras face glazed in and crossbarred even as mrs meldrums was glazed and barred he went on to assert that only the horror of that image looming out at herself could be the reason of her avoiding the person who so forced it home  the fact he had encountered made everything hideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just such another pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed to flora  i seei see i presently returned  what would become of lord iffield if she were suddenly to come out in them  what indeed would become of every one what would become of everything  this was an enquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and i completed it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you  once more he turned on me his good green eyes  oh i shouldnt mind  the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and i discovered at this moment how much i really liked him  none the less at the same time perversely and rudely i felt the droll side of our discussion of such alternatives  it made me laugh out and say to him while i laughed youd take her even with those things of mrs meldrums  he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised at my rude mirth  but he summoned back a vision of the lady at folkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things of mrs meldrums  i begged him not to resent my laughter which but exposed the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air  didnt he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested  the evidence was preposterously small  he believed the worst but we were really uninformed  i shall find out the truth he promptly replied  how can you  if you question her youll simply drive her to perjure herself  wherein after all does it concern you to know the truth  its the girls own affair  then why did you tell me your story  i was a trifle embarrassed  to warn you off i smiled  he took no more notice of these words than presently to remark that lord iffield had no serious intentions  very possibly i said  but you mustnt speak as if lord iffield and you were her only alternatives  dawling thought a moment  couldnt something be got out of the people she has consulted  she must have been to people  how else can she have been condemned  condemned to what  condemned to perpetual nippers  of course she has consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it you may be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it were supposable that they would tell you anythingwhich i altogether doubtyou would have great difficulty in finding out which men they are  therefore leave it alone never show her what you suspect  i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this  all right i promisebut he was gloomy enough  he was a lover facing the fact that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one was ready to practise it made so remarkably little difference  i could see by what a stretch his passionate pity would from this moment overlook the girls fatuity and folly  she was always accessible to himthat i knew for if she had told him he was an idiot to dream she could dream of him she would have rebuked the imputation of having failed to make it clear that she would always be glad to regard him as a friend  what were most of her friendswhat were all of thembut repudiated idiots  i was perfectly aware that in her conversations and confidences i myself for instance had a niche in the gallery  as regards poor dawling i knew how often he still called on the hammond synges  it was not there but under the wing of the floydtaylors that her intimacy with lord iffield most flourished at all events when a week after the visit i have just summarised floras name was one morning brought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had been with her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that he had broken his word     chapter ix   she left me after she had been introduced in no suspense about her present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiably panted our young man was not accountable  she had but one thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield  i had the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no other good it at least made me at last completely understand why insidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature of tragedy  in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted the curtain of her misery  i dont know how much she meant to tell me when she camei think she had had plans of elaborate misrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of ten minutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched and true  when she had once begun to let herself go the movement took her off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of a cramp  she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharp pain  she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears of helpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as in some of its consequences the most immediate of which was that i went that afternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms in welbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough to warrant the supposition that he might have come in  he had not come in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and wait for him a lady i was informed was already in his sittingroom  i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through my brain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt  but when i asked if she were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in this manner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum  oh you dear thing she exclaimed im delighted to see you you spare me another compromising demarche  but for this i should have called on you also  know the worst at once if you see me here its at least deliberateits planned plotted shameless  i came up on purpose to see him upon my word im in love with him  why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day at folkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes  i found myself there in half an hour simply infatuated with him  with a perfect sense of everything that can be urged against him i hold him none the less the very pearl of men  however i havent come up to declare my passionive come to bring him news that will interest him much more  above all ive come to urge upon him to be careful  about flora saunt  about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse  shes at last really engaged  but its a tremendous secret  i was moved to mirth  precisely she wired me this noon and spent another shilling to tell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it  she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passed an hour with the creature you see before you  she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried  theyve vital reasons she says for its not coming out for a month  then it will be formally announced but meanwhile her rejoicing is wild  i daresay mr dawling already knows and as its nearly seven oclock may have jumped off london bridge  but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day was to make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty to warn him in person against taking action so to call it on the horrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him  i had added somehow to that certitude  he told me what you had told him you had seen in your shop  mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errand identical with my owna circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very different thing from what floras wonderful visit had made of mine  i remarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficiently striking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in my studio  in short i said ive seen everything  she was mystified  everything  the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds  oh she came to triumph but she remained to talk something in the nature of sense  she put herself completely in my handsshe does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends im the most disinterested  after she had announced to me that lord iffield was utterly committed to her and that for the present i was absolutely the only person in the secret she arrived at her real business  she had had a suspicion of me ever since that day at folkestone when i asked her for the truth about her eyes  the truth is what you and i both guessed  shes in very bad danger  but from what cause  i who by gods mercy have kept mine know everything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum  she might have kept hers if she had profited by gods mercy if she had done in time done years ago what was imperatively ordered her if she hadnt in fine been cursed with the loveliness that was to make her behaviour a thing of fable  she may still keep her sight or what remains of it if shell sacrificeand after all so littlethat purely superficial charm  she must do as youve done she must wear dear lady what you wear  what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melonframe in august  heaven forgive hernow i understand  she flushed for dismay  but i wasnt afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thus seeing through her great goggles why it had always been that flora held her at such a distance  i cant tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her danger proceeds thats the one thing she succeeded this morning in keeping from me  she knows it herself perfectly she has had the best advice in europe  its a thing thats awful simply awfulthat was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floydtaylor to paris  she there surreptitiously consulted the greatest maneven mrs floydtaylor doesnt know  last autumn in germany she did the same  first put on certain special spectacles with a straight bar in the middle then well talkthats practically what they say  what she says is that shell put on anything in nature when shes married but that she must get married first  she has always meant to do everything as soon as shes married  then and then only shell be safe  how will any one ever look at her if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have got engaged if she had made herself a fright from the first  its no use to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright  she said to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic the most harrowing things  my face is all i haveand such a face  i knew from the first i could do anything with it  but i needed it alli need it still every exquisite inch of it  it isnt as if i had a figure or anything else  oh if god had only given me a figure too i dont say  yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floydtaylors whos hideous id have risked plain glasses  que voulez vous  no one is perfect  she says she still has money left but i dont believe a word of it  she has been speculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would hold off she has literally been running a race with it  her theory has been as you from the first so clearly saw that shed get in ahead  she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel she wears when shes alone what she has been ordered to wear  but when the deuce is she alone  its herself of course that she has swindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even her conceit but half accounts for it with little inadequate concessions little false measures and preposterous evasions and childish hopes  her great terror is now that iffield who already has suspicions who has found out her pincenez but whom she has beguiled with some unblushing hocuspocus may discover the dreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning was in that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly and authoritatively for isnt she my favourite sitter that she has anything in life the matter with any part of her  she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinary nerve left her and she showed me what she has been throughshowed me also all her terror of the harm i could do her  wait till im married wait till im married  she took hold of me she almost sank on her knees  it seems to me highly immoral ones participation in her fraud but theres no doubt that she must be married i dont know what i dont see behind it  therefore i wound up dawling must keep his hands off  mrs meldrum had held her breath she gave out a long moan  well thats exactly what i came here to tell him  then here he is  our host all unprepared his latchkey still in his hand had just pushed open the door and startled at finding us turned a frightened look from one to the other wondering what disaster we were there to announce or avert  mrs meldrum was on the spot all gaiety  ive come to return your sweet visit  ah she laughed i mean to keep up the acquaintance  dodo he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to look at us  then he broke out hes going to marry her  i was surprised  you already know  he produced an evening paper which he tossed down on the table  its in that  publishedalready i was still more surprised  oh flora cant keep a secretmrs meldrum made it light  she went up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him  its all rightits just as it ought to be dont think about her ever any more  then as he met this adjuration with a stare from which thought and of the most defiant and dismal fairly protruded the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderly kissed him on the cheek     chapter x   i have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i am rather proud of the comparison  the beads are all there as i saidthey slip along the string in their small smooth roundness  geoffrey dawling accepted as a gentleman the event his evening paper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to nudge him a hint that he might offer mrs meldrum his hand  he returned me a heavy headshake and i judged that marriage would henceforth strike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike some poor incurable at the window of an hospital  circumstances arising at this time led to my making an absence from england and circumstances already existing offered him a firm basis for similar action  he had after all the usual resource of a britonhe could take to his boats always drawn up in our background  he started on a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but my inference as to what might have happened  later observation however only confirmed my belief that if at any time during the couple of months after flora saunts brilliant engagement he had made up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that good lady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she was to behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged to administer that shove  i went to new york to paint a couple of portraits but i found once on the spot that i had counted without chicago where i was invited to blot out this harsh discrimination by the production of some dozen  i spent a year in america and should probably have spent a second had i not been summoned back to england by alarming news from my mother  her strength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried down to folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome to some slight symptom of a rally  she had been much worse but was now a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction in having come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place to await whatever might next occur  yet before returning to town i called on mrs meldrum from whom i had not had a line and my view of whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had been intercepted by a luxuriant foreground  before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed coming toward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiar twinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in the autumn and the esplanade a blank i was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a caper on the grass  my enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment for i had seen in a few more seconds that the person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my military friend  i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thought possible when on this persons drawing near i knew her for poor little flora saunt  at what moment she had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again once we were face to face it so chiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking entirely unastonished  all i at first saw was the big gold bar crossing each of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque like the eyes of a large insect something that now represented her whole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison to strain forward and press  the face had shrunk away it looked smaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so far as the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus of sight  there was no smile in it and she made no motion to take my offered hand  i had no idea you were down here i said and i wondered whether she didnt know me at all or knew me only by my voice  you thought i was mrs meldrum she ever so quietly answered  it was just this low pitch that made me protest with laughter  oh yes you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum  ive just returned to england after a long absence and im on my way to see her wont you come with me  it struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now  ive just left her  im staying with her  she stood solemnly fixing me with her goggles  would you like to paint me now she asked  she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind a mask or a cage  there was nothing to do but treat the question still with high spirits it would be a fascinating little artistic problem  that something was wrong it wasnt difficult to see but a good deal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if flora was under mrs meldrums roof  i hadnt for a year had much time to think of her but my imagination had had ground for lodging her in more gilded halls  one of the last things i had heard before leaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationship she had gone to stay with lady considine  this had made me take everything else for granted and the noisy american world had deafened my care to possible contradictions  her spectacles were at present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not only of new relationships but of every old one as well  i remember nevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on the grass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldnt as yet at any rate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off this danger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and without waiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my own doings  my companion was finely silent and i felt both as if she were watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and as if i were talking to some different and strange person  flora plain and obscure and dumb was no flora at all  at mrs meldrums door she turned off with the observation that as there was certainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she had better not go in with me i looked at her againi had been keeping my eyes away from herbut only to meet her magnified stare  i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone but there was something so grim in the girls trouble that i hesitated to fall in with this idea of dropping her  yet one couldnt express a compassion without seeming to take for granted more trouble than there actually might have been  i reflected that i must really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment i had never expected to give her  it rolled over me there for the first timeit has come back to me sincethat there is wondrously in very deep and even in very foolish misfortune a dignity still finer than in the most inveterate habit of being all right  i couldnt have to her the manner of treating it as a mere detail that i was face to face with a part of what at our last meeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying to think of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly though somehow as if she might never see me again goodbye  im going to take my walk  all alone  she looked round the great bleak clifftop  with whom should i go besides i like to be alonefor the present  this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded her disfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that she would never for her happiness cease to be a creature of illusions  it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feeling indeed idiotic oh i shall see you again  but i hope youll have a very pleasant walk  all my walks are pleasant thank youthey do me such a lot of good she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to me stupendous in their wisdom  i take several a day she continued  she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility at the church door to the patronage of the parson  the more i take the better i feel  im ordered by the doctors to keep all the while in the air and go in for plenty of exercise  it keeps up my general health you know and if that goes on improving as it has lately done everything will soon be all right  all that was the matter with me beforeand always it was too recklesswas that i neglected my general health  it acts directly on the state of the particular organ  so im going three miles  i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrums maid stood there to admit me  oh im so glad i said looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in the same observation  her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that but i recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marching away from it     chapter xi   as soon as i saw mrs meldrum i of course broke out  is there anything in it  is her general health  mrs meldrum checked me with her great amused blare  youve already seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale  whats in it is what has been in everything she has ever donethe most comical tragical belief in herself  she thinks shes doing a cure  and what does her husband think  her husband  what husband  hasnt she then married lord iffield  vousenetes la cried my hostess  why he behaved like a regular beast  how should i know  you never wrote me  mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ  no i didnt write youi abstained on purpose  if i kept quiet i thought you mightnt hear over there what had happened  if you should hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling  stir him up  urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there was another chance for him  i wouldnt have done it i said  well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give you an opportunity  in short you were afraid of it  again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy i thought she considerably reddened  at all events she laughed out  then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered  but doesnt he know  has he given no sign  every sign in lifehe came straight back to her  he did everything to get her to listen to him but she hasnt the smallest idea of it  has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifle awkwardly enquired  indeed he has and borne it like a hero  he told me all about it  how much youve all been through i found occasion to remark  then what has become of him  hes at home in hampshire  he has got back his old place and i believe by this time his old sisters  its not half a bad little place  yet its attractions say nothing to flora  oh floras by no means on her back my fried declared  shes not on her back because shes on yours  have you got her for the rest of your life  once more mrs meldrum genially glared  did she tell you how much the hammond synges have kindly left her to live on  not quite eighty pounds a year  thats a good deal but it wont pay the oculist  what was it that at last induced her to submit to him  her general collapse after that brute of an iffields rupture  she cried her eyes outshe passed through a horror of black darkness  then came a gleam of light and the light appears to have broadened  she went into goggles as repentant magdalens go into the catholic church  in spite of which you dont think shell be saved  she thinks she willthats all i can tell you  theres no doubt that when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy as she calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known  that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it most refreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in her foolish little mind a belief that as she says shes on the mend and that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthy life shell be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerous again as ever  it keeps her going  and what keeps you  youre good until the parties begin again  oh she doesnt object to me now smiled mrs meldrum  im going to take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair  i was struck with this energy and after a moment i enquired the reason of it  its to divert her mind my friend replied reddening again a little i thought  we shall go next week ive only waited to see how your mother would be before starting  i expressed to her hereupon my sense of her extraordinary merit and also that of the inconceivability of floras fancying herself still in a situation not to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling  she says hes too ugly she says hes too dreary she says in fact hes nobody mrs meldrum pursued  she says above all that hes not her own sort  she doesnt deny that hes good but she finds him impossibly ridiculous  hes quite the last person she would ever dream of  i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest that if the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor had perhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to just how her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to apply to him the invidious term i have already quoted  what had happened was simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in the attempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmity and that his lordships interest in her had not been proof against the discovery of the way she had practised on him  her dissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernally deep  the future in short assumed a new complexion for him when looked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had said to some one couldnt really when you came to find out see her hand before her face  he had conducted himself like any other jockeyed customerhe had returned the animal as unsound  he had backed out in his own way giving the business by some sharp shuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly floras but he had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out  he had cared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and haunted way it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care and her lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun to rig upon it was just what had let him in  he had in the judgment of his family done everything that could be expected of him he had mademrs meldrum had herself seen the lettera handsome offer of pecuniary compensation  oh if flora with her incredible buoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that she had not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust  strange were the humiliations the forms of anguish it was given some natures to survive  that flora had survived was perhaps after all a proof she was reserved for some final mercy  but she has been in the abysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really dont think i can tell you what pulled her through  i think i can tell you i returned  what in the world but mrs meldrum  at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged to announce that i should have but time to reach the station where i was to find my luggage in charge of my mothers servant  mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave this alternative a consideration less acute than i pretended  somehow i didnt care if i did lose our young lady  now that i knew the worst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible to meet her on the ground of condolence and with the sad appearance she wore to me what other ground was left  i lost her but i caught my train  in truth she was so changed that one hated to see it and now that she was in charitable hands one didnt feel compelled to make great efforts  i had studied her face for a particular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it was gone for ever     chapter xii   i was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and her young friend had already left england finding to that end every convenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town  my thoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should in any case have had little attention for them the event occurred that was to bring my series of visits to a close  when this high tide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge into a great chance i was three good years in rising again to the surface  there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the american depths they may have had something to do with the duration of my dive  i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanorthe fact that after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum  she had written to me from florence after my mothers death and had mentioned in a postscript that in our young ladys calculations the lowest figures were now italian counts  this was a good omen and if in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i was content to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course  the gravity of what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time and distance less appreciable and i was not without an impression that mrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of her merits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs of her pensioner  the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitful memory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of how kind mrs meldrum would always be to her  i was professionally more preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of pretty faces in my eyes and a chorus of loud tones in my ears  geoffrey dawling had on his return to england written me two or three letters his last information had been that he was going into the figures of rural illiteracy  i was delighted to receive it and had no doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they are said to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advice was sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on my part another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumouri forget how it reached methat he was engaged to a girl down in hampshire  he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if only he went into figures deep enough he would become among the girls down in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes of battle whose defences are practically not on the scale of their provocations  i nursed in short the thought that it was probably open to him to develop as one of the types about whom as the years go on superficial critics wonder without relief how they ever succeeded in dragging a bride to the altar  he never alluded to flora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as in mrs meldrums an element of instinctive tact a brief implication that if you didnt happen to have been in love with her there was nothing to be said  within a week after my return to london i went to the opera of which i had always been much of a devotee  i arrived too late for the first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house  when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place in the stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless on their contents the reflections pointed by comparison that are most familiar to the wanderer restored to london  there was the common sprinkling of pretty women but i suddenly noted that one of these was far prettier than the others  this lady alone in one of the smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim of fifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirable serenity this single exquisite figure placed in the quarter furthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause ones curiosity to linger  dressed in white with diamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a pale radiance of beauty which even at that distance made her a distinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches to lonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery  a mystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i had levelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startled thrill the shock almost of joy with which i translated her vague brightness into a resurrection of flora  i say a resurrection because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left our young woman for dead  at present perfectly alive again she was altered only as it were by this fact of life  a little older a little quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she was simply transfigured by having recovered  sustained by the reflection that even her recovery wouldnt enable her to distinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well  then it was it came home to me that my vision of her in her great goggles had been cruelly final  as her beauty was all there was of her that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i had thought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried in the tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that she had escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if i didnt straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and up to her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some moments longer by the simple inability to cease looking at her  she had been from the first of my seeing her practically motionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtful grace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed on me to one of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over my head and out of my sight  the only movement she made for some time was to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit of fondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me to be large and splendid  her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in the days of the hammond synges wonder what undreamtof improvement had taken place in her fortunes  the ghost of a question hovered there a moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that on her tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could scarce have without my hearing of it and moreover if she had become a person of such fashion where was the little court one would naturally see at her elbow  her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone  if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have taken advantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other boxdoubtless the box at which flora had just been looking  mrs meldrum didnt account for the jewels but the revival of floras beauty accounted for anything  she presently moved her eyes over the house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove  i dont know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that she would at last see me  she did see me she suddenly bent forward to take up the little doublebarrelled ivory glass that rested on the edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it  i smiled from my place straight up at the searching lenses and after an instant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me  oh her smileit was her old smile her young smile her very own smile made perfect  i instantly left my stall and hurried off for a nearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with the annoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i had tried to paint her  poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his  i hadnt touched her i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in the lobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing i should have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit to me again     chapter xiii   she gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from her chair she turned her face to me  here you are again she exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for me to take  i dropped into a chair just behind her and having taken it and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make the demonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it and impressed them on its fingertips  it was given me however to my astonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the world couldnt have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to her face she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twisting herself round a vacant challenging stare  during the next few instants several extraordinary things happened the first of which was that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had come up to look into didnt show at all the conscious light i had just been pleased to see them flash across the house they showed on the contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness an expression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay i felt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effect of her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched from me  it was the irrepressible question in this grasp that stopped on my lips all sound of salutation  she had mistaken my entrance for that of another person a pair of lips without a moustache  she was feeling me to see who i was  with the perception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her and at the wild word that didnt come the right word to express or to disguise my dismay  what was the right word to commemorate ones sudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count on better things that ones dear old friend had gone blind  before the answer to this question dropped upon meand the moving moments though few seemed manyi heard with the sound of voices the click of the attendants key on the other side of the door  poor flora heard also and on hearing still with her hand on my arm brightened again as i had a minute since seen her brighten across the house she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me forthe person with the right pair of lips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark than she  i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she had found again her beauty  i managed to speak while we were still alone before her companion had appeared  youre lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life  at the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her impatience broke into audible joy  she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me he has come back he has come back and you should have heard what he says of me  the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought it best to let him hear on the spot  how beautiful she is my dear manbut how extraordinarily beautiful  more beautiful at this hour than ever ever before  it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush to his eyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepened astonishment a blest snap of the strain i had been struggling with  i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars of another scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been a consciousness of guilt  i had caught him somehow in the act though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we sank noiselessly into our chairs againfor the music was supreme wagner passed firstmy demonstration ought pretty well to have given him the limit of the criticism he had to fear  i myself indeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divine in our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which was simply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if our companions beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life  i had hit on the right notethat was what eased me off it drew all pain for the next halfhour from the sense of the deep darkness in which the stricken woman sat  if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unison with those of a gratified passion  a great deal came and went between us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel at the end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he might in kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared at her from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystal and by appearing to recognise me and smile  she leaned back in her chair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware that the way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the wedded state  nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but i hadnt then dreamed of the art with which she would wear that assurance as a married woman  she had taken him when everything had failed he had taken her when she herself had done so  his embarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace he found in it  they only didnt tell me why he had not written to me nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity  flora after a while again lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantly swept the house with it  then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the void with the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfect imitation of response to some homage  dawling and i looked at each other again the tears came into his eyes  she was playing at perfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process  i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainly as i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune  neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and flora would never name it at all  little by little i saw that what had occurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for her happiness  the question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited to that  such an activity was all within her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldnt splendidly give  as from time to time in our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none of the signs of its strange new glory  the expression of the eyes was a rub of pastel from a masters thumb the whole head stamped with a sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she had passed through yes flora was settled for lifenothing could hurt her further  i foresaw the particular praise she would mostly incurshe would be invariably interesting  she would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure  for herself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all change and ransomed from all doubt  her old certainties her old vanities were justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closed upon her one object remained clear  that object as unfading as a mosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly look upon  the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawling thought so  her future was ruled with the straightest line and so for that matter was his  there were two facts to which before i left my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit  one was that he had changed by some process as effective as floras change had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified into success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as i had never yet conceived he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible any reference even on her own part to his wifes infirmity  oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it  he principally after a while made me feeland this was my second lessonthat goodnatured as he was my being there to see it all oppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised that i too had filled out my hour  dawling remembered things i think he caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they made him thresh about in his chair  i said to flora as i took leave of her that i would come to see her but i may mention that i never went  id go tomorrow if i hear she wants me but what in the world can she ever want  as i quitted them i laid my hand on dawlings arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby  why did you never write to me of your marriage  he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth and something more  i dont knowthe whole thing gave me such a tremendous lot to do  this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make he really hadnt written because an idea that i would think him a still bigger fool than before  i didnt insist but i tried there in the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me to give him a notion of what i thought him  i cant at any rate make out i said why i didnt hear from mrs meldrum  she didnt write to you  never a word  what has become of her  i think shes at folkestone dawling returned but im sorry to say that practically she has ceased to see us  you havent quarrelled with her  how could we  think of all we owe her  at the time of our marriage and for months before she did everything for us i dont know how we should have managed without her  but since then she has never been near us and has given us rather markedly little encouragement to keep up relations with her  i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck with all sorts of things  well i said after a moment even if i could imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldnt explain why she shouldnt have taken account of my natural interest  just so  dawlings face was a windowless wall  he could contribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried it away  it was not till i went down to ace mrs meldrum that was really dispelled  she didnt want to hear of them or to talk of them not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadnt wanted to write of them  she had done everything in the world for them but now thank heaven the hard business was over  after i had taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided the subject  she simply couldnt bear it
